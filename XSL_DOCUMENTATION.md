# Documentation justifying each XSL file

Must contain an entry for each XSL file justifying the need for this. The more detail the better.

Documentation should include recommendations for how each XSL file could ultimately be removed by one of:
- improved biorXiv XML
- better handling of XML in Encoda
- better support for Encoda output in EPP client

Please provide links to github issues which express these requirements.

In the entry for each XSL file please link to the file in github.
