<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In this study, we present an allosteric mechanism for T cell receptor (TCR) triggering upon binding a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC), in which a conformational change in the TCR upon pMHC binding controls the mobility of the CD3 proteins. We found that the TCR&#x03B2; FG loop serves as a gatekeeper, preventing accidental triggering, while the connecting peptide acts as a hinge for essential conformational changes in the TCR. Atomistic simulations and cell-based experiments with genetically modified connecting peptides demonstrate that rigidified hinge residues result in excessive CD3 dynamics and hypersensitivity to pMHC binding. Our model thus provides a clear connection between extracellular TCR-pMHC binding and changes in CD3 dynamic that propagate from outside to inside the cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>T cell receptors (TCRs) specifically recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The TCR is a heterodimer composed of an &#x0251; and a &#x03B2; chain that forms a complex with three CD3 dimers (CD3&#x03B3;&#x03B5;, CD3&#x03B4;&#x03B5; and CD3&#x03B6;&#x03B6;) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The binding of agonistic, but not antagonistic, peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes results in Lck-mediated phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The ITAMs, whose phosphorylation is required for T cell activation, are located on the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3s. Current evidence suggests that the CD3 ITAMs are hidden in the membrane in the resting state, but are exposed to the cytoplasmic kinase Lck upon pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The effector functions of activated T cells range from killing infected cells to inhibition of immune responses to establishment of memory of specific peptide antigens. Although TCRs have been intensively studied for several decades, the mechanisms linking pMHC engagement to TCR triggering remain elusive. It has been difficult to rationalize how TCR-pMHC binding could result in changes in the cytoplasmic regions, since the TCR chains lack a proper cytoplasmic domain, while the CD3 proteins are too short to interact with the pMHC. The fact that the TCR and CD3 associate non-covalently further complicates the problem.</p>

<p>In the last decade, a number of models of TCR triggering and T cell activation, each emphasizing different aspects of the phenomenon, have been proposed. The relationship between initial pMHC engagement and cytoplasmic signaling is described by the <italic>mechanosensor</italic> model, in which TCRs discriminate agonistic from antagonistic pMHCs via catch bond formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In this model, pMHC binding transfers force from the pMHC-TCR interface to the TCR-CD3 interface via the TCR&#x03B2;-FG loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In the <italic>kinetic proofreading</italic> model, the binding lifetime of the pMHC-TCR complex enables differentiation of agonistic pMHCs from antagonistic ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The <italic>TCR bending mechanosignal</italic> model argues that TCR-pMHC engagement alters membrane curvature, which, in turn, promotes conformational changes in the receptors that result in TCR triggering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Alternatively, in the <italic>allosteric relaxation</italic> model, TCR-pMHC binding decouples TCR and CD3&#x03B6; interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, each of these models requires a yet unknown coupling between the TCR and CD3 that must ultimately be transmitted to the cytoplasm. The coupling and transmission are crucial because the CD3 chains &#x2013; not TCR&#x0251;&#x03B2; &#x2013; contain the ITAMs.</p>
<p>In 2019, the first full-length TCR-CD3 complex structure was determined by single particle cryo-EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the extracellular domain (EC) of the TCR was bent with respect to the membrane. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of the TCR showed that the angle between the TCR EC and transmembrane domain (TM) is dynamic, allowing the TCR EC to adopt a range of different conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In 2022, the structure of a pMHC-bound TCR-CD3 complex revealed that the TCR was unchanged by the binding to a soluble pMHC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We reasoned that, since the static structures of pMHC-bound and unbound TCRs do not reveal an obvious triggering mechanism, the dynamics of the complex might hold clues. To this end, we used extensive multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interplay of TCR, CD3 and pMHC. The resulting picture is one in which CD3 dynamics plays a central role in distinguishing between bound and unbound TCRs.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Description of the simulation systems</title>
<p>To study the dynamics of the TCR under resting and pMHC-engaged conditions, two simulation systems were constructed: a TCR-CD3 system and a TCR-CD3-pMHC system. The TCR-CD3 system consisted of a single TCR-CD3 complex embedded in a POPC bilayer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), while the TCR-CD3-pMHC system was composed of two opposing POPC bilayer slabs with the lower containing a TCR-CD3 complex and the upper containing a pMHC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The simulations were performed before the recently reported TCR-CD3-pMHC structure was published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>; therefore, to model the complex, we created a chimeric TCR in which the TCR transmembrane (TM) region from the De Dong (PDB: 6jxr)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> structure was docked onto the pMHC-TCR complex structure by Newell (PDB: 3qiu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Harmonic potentials centered on the crystal structure were used to tether the TCR to the pMHC; the potentials were applied in a stepwise manner during 1.5 &#x00B5;s of preparatory simulations to allow the system to incrementally adjust (Figure S1). A pore was created in the pMHC-bound membrane to allow the flow of solvent between the two membrane compartments; this flow was required to permit the distance between the two membranes to fluctuate naturally. For each system, one hundred 10 &#x00B5;s production runs were performed, totaling 1 ms per system.</p>
<p><italic>CD3&#x03B5; chains manifest a wider range of motion in the TCR-CD3-pMHC than the TCR-CD3 system</italic> Iso-occupancy surfaces were calculated to examine the distribution of the CD3&#x03B5; chains in the two systems. In the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the CD3&#x03B5; chains sampled a larger area around the TCR compared to the TCR-CD3 simulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In the TCR-CD3 simulations, the iso-occupancy surface of the CD3&#x03B5; chains had a clear minimum close to the position of the CD3&#x03B6; chains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the CD3&#x03B5; chains completely sampled the region around the TCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the iso-occupancy surface in the TCR-CD3 simulation was not symmetric &#x2013; the iso-occupancy was particularly low around the CD3&#x03B6; chain adjacent to CD3&#x03B3; (CD3&#x03B6;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup>). This difference was also apparent when the CD3&#x03B5; chain position was expressed in polar coordinates and the density plotted in a plane parallel to the membrane: The TCR-CD3 simulations indicated an excluded region from 225-315&#x00B0;, which was occupied in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations. Taken together, these results indicate that TCR-pMHC binding results in a greater range of CD3&#x03B5; motion.</p>

In the TCR-CD3 simulations, the TCR&#x03B2; variable domain was constantly in contact with the CD3&#x03B3;&#x03B5; dimer, but these interactions virtually disappeared in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations. In the TCR-CD3 systems, the TCR&#x03B2; variable domain made on average 7445 (stdev 7215) contacts per simulation with CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup> &#x2013; the CD3&#x03B5; next to CD3&#x03B3;. In addition, the TCR&#x03B2; variable domain made on average 1581 (stdev 2848) contacts per simulation with CD3&#x03B3;. In the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations, the number of contacts dropped to 195 (stdev 625) and 3 (stdev 14) for CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup>&#x2013;TCR&#x03B2; and CD3&#x03B3;&#x2013;TCR&#x03B2; variable domain contacts, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>The TCR is more extended in the TCR-CD3-pMHC complex</title>
<p>To understand the structural basis for the loss of CD3-TCR contacts and increase in CD3 dynamics upon pMHC binding, we next examined the conformation of the TCR in the two simulations. The TCR adopted a different orientation relative to the membrane in the TCR-CD3 and TCR-CD3-pMHC systems, as measured by the TCR EC tilt, the angle between the TCR&#x03B2; transmembrane domain (TM) and the extracellular domain (EC) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In the TCR-CD3 system, the TCR EC folded over the CD3 proteins, and the TCR adopted predominantly bent conformations (smaller tilt angles) with a peak in the angular distribution of approximately 104&#x00B0; (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Such TCR bending has been observed in previous TCR-CD3 simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, in the TCR-CD3-pMHC system, the TCRs had more extended and open conformations (larger tilt angles) with a peak in the angular distribution of approximately 150&#x00B0;, which was close to the initial angle observed in the cryo-EM structures. Thus, upon pMHC binding, the TCR EC tilted away from the CD3 proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the width of angular distributions was narrower in the TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of approximately 30&#x00B0;, compared to that in the TCR-CD3 simulations (FWHM 40&#x00B0;). These observations were consistent with the decrease in contacts and increase in dynamics in the TCR-CD3-pMHC systems compared with the TCR-CD3 simulations.</p>

<title>The TCR-pMHC complex acts as drawbridge for the CD3 proteins</title>
<p>These observations suggest that the binding status of the TCR affects its conformation, which, in turn, affects CD3&#x03B5; movement. Upon pMHC binding, the TCR adopts a more extended conformation, which breaks contacts between the TCR variable region and the CD3 proteins, allowing the CD3&#x03B5; chains to diffuse around the TCR. In this manner, the TCR-pMHC complex acts as a &#x201C;drawbridge&#x201D; that releases the CD3 proteins, resulting in their increased movement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It is reasonable to hypothesize that, over time, the increase dynamics upon drawbridge formation is transmitted to the ITAMs, ultimately resulting in their phosphorylation.</p>

Upon pMHC binding (<italic>right</italic>), the TCR becomes extended, which weakens binding to CD3 and allows CD3 diffusion around the TCR.

In unbound conditions the TCR&#x0251; AB loop and the TCR&#x03B2; H3 helix were out of reach of the CD3 proteins because they were bound by the TCR EC; however, upon TCR-pMHC binding, the CD3 proteins were released and moved to previously inaccessible areas of the TCR.</p>

In our simulations we observed that when the TCR was not bound by pMHC, the TCR&#x03B2; FG loop interacted with CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup> and blocked its diffusion away from the TCR&#x03B2; chain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref>). Upon TCR-pMHC binding, the TCR&#x03B2; FG loop moved up and no longer interacted with the CD3 proteins, which were subsequently free to diffuse around the TCR&#x03B2;. TCR&#x0251; lacks an equivalent loop, which explains the asymmetry in the iso-occupancy maps.

<title>Critical role of the connecting peptide in TCR dynamics</title>
<p>If TCR triggering depends on TCR EC movement, a change in TCR chain flexibility would be expected to affect TCR activation. We identified a conserved GxxG motif in the TCR&#x03B2; connecting peptide (CP) that represents a potential hinge (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Whereas the TCR&#x0251; CP is long and flexible, the TCR&#x03B2; CP is short, which increases the importance of the two glycine residues in the hinge. Moreover, the TCR&#x0251; and TCR&#x03B2; CPs are attached to each other by a disulfide bond, which suggests that global changes in the TCR are mediated by these glycine residues. To test whether the CP in TCR&#x03B2; indeed functions as a hinge, we examined double alanine (AA) or proline (PP) substitutions using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic simulations with the CHARMM36m forcefield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> of a TCR-CD3 complex in the absence of pMHC were used to assess the effect of the CP on the intrinsic flexibility of the TCR EC.</p>

<p>The atomistic simulations showed that rigidification of the CP by glycine-to-proline mutations increased CD3&#x03B5; dynamics, whereas a milder mutation of both glycines to alanines did not significantly affect CD3&#x03B5; dynamics (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, S6A). The mutations also changed the pattern of contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains. Both the proline and the alanine substitutions decreased the net number of interactions between the TCR variable region and CD3&#x03B4;&#x03B5; dimer as compared to wild type, but mutation to proline increased contacts between the TCR&#x03B2; variable domain and CD3&#x03B3; (Figure S6B). In line with the TCR-CD3 coarse-grained simulations, the wild-type and mutant TCRs adopted a bent conformation in the atomistic simulations with smaller EC-to-TM angles than that of the cryo-EM structure. The PP mutant adopted even smaller angles than the wild type, and, surprisingly, the bent conformations were decoupled from the CD3 subunits (Figure S6C-D). This suggested that the TCR tilt is not sufficient to describe the interactions between TCR and CD3. In the simulations of Pandey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the TCR EC not only varied its tilt, but also rotated. Indeed, calculation of the TCR EC rotation showed that the proline mutant had a skewed TCR EC &#x2013; the PP mutant adopted rotation angles as low as &#x223C;75&#x00B0;; in contrast, rotation angles lower than 100&#x00B0; were almost absent in the wild-type TCR (Figure S6E-F). The skewedness of the proline TCR was also apparent from the TCR and CD3 contacts&#x2013; the wild-type TCR mostly contacted the CD3&#x03B4;&#x03B5; dimer, whereas the proline mutant interacted mostly with the CD3&#x03B3;&#x03B5; dimer located on the other side of the TCR (Figure S5B). The wild-type TCR restrained CD3&#x03B4; via contacts between TCR&#x0251; and the CD3&#x03B4; FG loop, but the proline mutant could not reach CD3&#x03B4; due to its skewed conformation (Figure S6G-H). These <italic>in silico</italic> mutation simulations were consistent with a model in which the CP functions as a hinge for the drawbridge, and that rigidification of the hinge by proline substitution locks the bridge in a skewed state in which the TCR can no longer properly restrain the CD3 chains, resulting in their increased mobility.</p>

<p>These experiments showed that reporter cells bearing the mutant TCR were more easily activated, which suggests that rigidification of the CP by mutation to proline, and to a lesser extent to alanine, resulted in TCR hypersensitivity. This is in line with the atomistic simulations in which the proline mutant was less able to couple to the CD3 proteins due to rigidification of the CP and skewing of the TCR EC. These experiments provide support for the hypothesis that the TCR CP functions as a hinge and underlie the importance of TCR EC movement and CD3 mobility for TCR triggering.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism of TCR triggering in which TCR-pMHC binding is signaled across the plasma membrane, resulting in phosphorylation of ITAMs on cytoplasmic CD3 tails, is still not fully resolved. It has been difficult to conceptualize how TCR-pMHC binding results in ITAM phosphorylation: the TCR&#x0251;&#x03B2; chains lack a proper cytoplasmic domain and the CD3 proteins are too short to interact with the pMHC. In this study, the behavior of the TCR-CD3-pMHC complex was investigated using extensive multi-scale simulations, resulting in a model in which TCR-pMHC binding allows dynamic movement of the CD3 proteins.</p>
<p>Coarse-grained simulations showed that the TCR adopts a bent conformation when not bound to pMHCs. In this bound state, the TCR EC binds to the CD3 proteins, restricting their movement. The TCR&#x03B2; FG loop hereby acts as a gatekeeper, preventing accidental TCR triggering by CD3 diffusion when the TCR is unbound. TCR-pMHC binding requires the TCR to elongate, breaking its interactions with the CD3 proteins and allowing them to diffuse freely. The simulations also indicated the importance of the CP, a flexible region linking the TCR&#x2019;s transmembrane region with its extracellular domain, for the TCR to adopt the necessary conformational changes. The TCR&#x03B1; CP is longer, while the TCR&#x03B2; CP is much shorter but contains two flexible glycine residues. Together the CPs allow the TCR-pMHC to act like a &#x201C;drawbridge&#x201D;, which either blocks the CD3 proteins or lets them pass freely.</p>
<p>Atomistic simulations and experiments provided further support for the crucial role of the TCR CP. The simulations showed that TCR-CD3 complexes in which the two glycines in the CP were replaced with prolines resulted in a skewed TCR that was less effective in retaining the CD3 proteins. This was confirmed by experiments using reporter cells transfected with either wild-type or mutant TCRs. Activation of reporter cells with the proline mutant TCR was found to be more efficient than wild type, suggesting that CD3 mobility is a key step in TCR triggering.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model provides a solution to how TCR-pMHC binding is signaled to the CD3 proteins but does not reveal how increased CD3 mobility upon TCR-pMHC binding results in ITAM phosphorylation. The predominant theory is that the ITAMs are sequestered in the membrane, but that changes in the lipid microenvironment upon TCR-pMHC binding results in their release from the membrane and their exposure to Lck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. It is reasonable to hypothesize that, in the resting state, when the TCR is not bound to pMHC, the CD3 cytosolic tails are sequestered in lipid rafts. Increased CD3 dynamics upon TCR-pMHC binding would likely disrupt these lipid rafts by inducing a disordered phase, dispersing the lipids. If ITAMs in particular associate with certain lipids in these rafts, such as charged lipids, disruption of lipid rafts could result in the release of ITAMs. This hypothesis is supported by two experimental observations: first, lipid rafts are known to be present in the T cell membrane and are involved in T cell signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>; second, cholesterol, which induces liquid-ordered phases and is an important component of lipid rafts, has been shown to decrease TCR triggering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Further work will be needed to elucidate the detailed implications of CD3 dynamics on ITAM phosphorylation, but the overall notion that triggering is associated with greater CD3 dynamics appears sound.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model posits that the TCR is flexible and adopts a bent conformation when not bound to a pMHC. However, this conformation has not yet been directly observed experimentally; rather, in the three reported single particle cryo-EM structures of the TCR-CD3 complex, the TCR exists in an extended conformation, similar to that observed in our TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. One possible explanation for the structural homogeneity observed in the reported single particle cryo-EM structures is that, because of the experimental procedures used in the preparation of the TCR-CD3 complex for structure determination, the physiological environment of the cell membrane had to be removed. In addition, it was also required to stabilize the complex by the use of chemical crosslinking, introduction of antibodies or the use of specialized cryo-grids in order to arrive at a consensus structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The study by Dong and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, for example, employed 0.1&#x0025; glutaraldehyde for cross linking transmembrane helices while that of Su&#x0161;ac and co-workers used graphene coated grids and Fabs for TCR stabilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The absence of a native membrane is especially relevant since movement of the TCR-EC was found to be coupled to changes in the transmembrane helices in the previous work by Pandey and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in TCR-CD3 MD simulations reported to date, TCR bending was observed consistently, despite the use of three different forcefields &#x2013; Amber99SB-ILDN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and CHARMM36m and the Martini 3 forcefields, in this work. There is, moreover, experimental support for a reversible conformational change in the TCR from single molecule studies of isolated cells using optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Similar work on the pre-TCR resulted in a model in which the pre-TCR EC moves due to the scanning motion of the APC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Consistently, changes in chemical shift were observed not only in constant regions, but also in the TCR&#x0251;&#x03B2; variable regions upon titration with CD3&#x03B3;&#x03B5; and CD3&#x03B4;&#x03B5;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, providing support for the idea that the TCR&#x0251;&#x03B2; variable region interacts dynamically with CD3 proteins.</p>
<p>There is also experimental support for the drawbridge model in the literature. Long-range perturbations have been observed in the TCR&#x03B2; FG loop, TCR&#x03B1; AB loop, and TCR&#x03B2; H3 helix upon TCR-pMHC binding using a range of techniques, including NMR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and fluorescence measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. These studies have revealed structural changes in the TCR far from the binding interface upon TCR-pMHC binding that have been difficult to rationalize. Our model argues that the long-range interactions are due to changes in the TCR-CD3 interactions. In the unbound state, the CD3 proteins are bound by the TCR EC, but upon TCR-pMHC binding the TCR elongates and the CD3s diffuse around the TCR. The CD3 proteins are thus able to interact with regions like the TCR&#x03B1; AB loop and TCR&#x03B2; H3 helix of the TCR, which are not accessible in the unbound state. The TCR&#x03B2; FG loop has thereby a special role as a gatekeeper, blocking the movement of the CD3 proteins by interacting with CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup> in the unbound state, but moving out of the way after TCR-pMHC binding, and thus preventing inadvertent TCR triggering. Additional support comes from hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, which point to a rigidification of the TCR upon TCR-pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which is consistent with the narrower angle distribution of the pMHC bound TCR in our simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that a decrease in TCR-CD3 interactions occurs upon TCR-pMHC binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and specifically between the TCR and CD3&#x03B6;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Consistently, our simulations also show a decrease in TCR-CD3&#x03B6; interactions upon TCR-pMHC binding (Figure S3). This decrease in TCR-CD3 association is in line with the increased mobility of the CD3 and an elongated TCR that cannot interact with the CD3 upon TCR-pMHC binding. Lastly, molecular docking studies utilizing NMR data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> resulted in a model in which the CD3&#x03B4;&#x03B5; and CD3&#x03B3;&#x03B5; dimers were positioned on opposite sides of the TCR&#x03B1;&#x03B2; complex. This model differs qualitatively from the recent cryo-EM structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, providing support for a model based on CD3 mobility and structural heterogeneity.</p>
<p>The drawbridge model is consistent with recent findings that monomeric TCRs can be triggered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and integrates well with the modern framework of TCR triggering, such as the mechanosensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and kinetic proofreading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The initial encounter between TCR and pMHC is described by the mechanosensing model, which posits that agonistic pMHCs are distinguished through the formation of catch-bonds, special bonds that withstand the shear stress created by the scanning motion of the T cell over the APC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The drawbridge model expands on this by proposing that these catch-bonds must also be strong enough to maintain the TCR in the elongated state. The kinetic proofreading model enhances the specificity of T cell activation by imposing a temporal requirement, such that only TCR-pMHC interactions that persist for a sufficient amount of time result in T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This is achieved via a series of reversible biochemical steps, and the elongation of the drawbridge can be seen as part of this process. Successful TCR triggering can only occur when the TCR remains in an elongated state for long enough to allow for the continuous diffusion of the CD3 proteins, which ultimately depends on the stability of the complex formed between the TCR and pMHC. Our molecular dynamics simulations thus link the upstream formation of catch-bonds with the downstream kinetic proofreading process, providing a more comprehensive understanding of TCR triggering.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a wide range of evidence supports a mechanism in which TCR-pMHC binding is coupled to the dynamics of the CD3 EC domains, which is propagated across the plasma membrane. Further work is needed to confirm the flexibility of the TCR headgroup and to investigate how CD3 diffusion results in ITAM phosphorylation. Another interesting direction is the exploitation of this model for manipulation of T cell activation on demand. In this context, it will be interesting to revisit the molecular mechanism of anti-CD3 antibodies, which are used to control T cell activation both in the laboratory and in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Our aim was to examine a conventional TCR-MHC complex, but the extracellular part of the TCR electron densities of the De Dong et al. structure were fitted to the coordinates of an atypical natural killer TCR. Therefore, a chimeric structure was created by fusing the structure of De Dong et al.

For the CD3 proteins and the transmembrane part of the TCR, the structure of De Dong was used. The ITAM fragments were not present in the structure by De Dong et al. and were modeled according to the murine sequence (see below). The structure by Newell et al. served as the basis for the MHC and the extracellular parts of the TCR.

<title>Positioning of TCR and MHC</title>
<p>TCR and pMHC were carefully positioned on top of each other in preparatory 1.5 &#x00B5;s simulations. The TCR and MHC were embedded in opposing membrane slabs, which were separated by &#x223C;21 nm (GL1-GL1 bead distance) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A set of distance restraints based upon the Newell structure (PDB: 3qiu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> was defined between the TCR and pMHC (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). During the 1.5 &#x00B5;s docking simulation, a low force constant of 1 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> was used to prevent any deformations. During the docking simulation, the TCR and pMHC were slowly pulled together by distance restraints resulting in a bound TCR-CD3-pMHC structure (Figure S1). In the production simulations, a higher force constant of 200 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> was used to keep the pMHC properly bound to the TCR. In order to allow solvent flow between the two membrane compartments, which in turn allows the bilayers to move, a pore was created in the bilayer containing the MHC. The pore was created using two cylinder shaped inverted flat bottom position restraints (function type 2, shape <italic>g</italic> &#x003D; 8 in Gromacs). The first restraint, which was used to create the actual pore, acted on POPC beads with a force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> and a radius of 2 nm. The second restraint with a force constant of 2000 kJ mol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> nm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> and a radius of 4 nm acting on the MHC backbone beads was used to prevent MHC TM diffusion into the pore. The preparatory simulations were performed for each of the one hundred TCR-CD3-pMHC simulations independently.</p>

<p>The protein systems were embedded in POPC bilayers using the Insane script<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The TCR was embedded in a POPC bilayer of 1279 lipids (651 lipids in the extracellular leaflet and 628 lipids in the intracellular leaflet). The pMHC was embedded in a POPC bilayer of 1278 lipids (640 lipids in the extracellular leaflet and 638 lipids in the intracellular leaflet).

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The first 1 &#x00B5;s of each coarse-grained production simulation was discarded as equilibration, and the remaining (9 &#x00B5;s) trajectories were analyzed every 10 ns. The first 250 ns of the atomistic simulations were discarded as equilibration and the remaining (2.25 &#x00B5;s) trajectories were analyzed every 1 ns. The TCR tilt, defined as the angle between the TCR&#x03B2; EC and TM was calculated for simulation systems between the backbone beads (coarse-grained systems) or C&#x0251; atoms (atomistic simulations) of asparagine 97 serine 249 and valine 281 of the TCR&#x03B2; chain. The tilt of the TCR in the cryo-EM structure was calculated between the C&#x0251; atoms of arginine 114, serine 268 and valine 300. Note that serine 249/268 and valine 281/300 are the corresponding residues in the simulation systems and cryo-EM structure, arginine 114 was chosen for its proximity to asparagine when superimposing the simulated structure and the cryo-EM structure. The rotation of the TCR EC was calculated as the angle between two planes. Plane 1 was defined by the C&#x0251; atoms used for the tilt TCR EC tilt calculation: asparagine 97 serine 249 and valine 281 of the TCR &#x03B2; chain. Plane 2 was defined by the C&#x0251; atoms of TCR&#x03B2; asparagine 97, TCR&#x03B2; glycine 14 and TCR&#x0251; serine 18. Iso-occupancy maps were calculated using the Volmap tool in VMD. For the iso-occupancy maps both the backbone and the sidechain beads were used. Grid spacing was set to 2 &#x00C5; and counting of grid occupancy was performed after fitting the trajectories on the backbone beads of the TCR chains. Contacts between the TCR and CD3 chains were calculated with in-house python scripts making use of the MDAnalysis library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. For both coarse-grained and atomistic simulations, beads or atoms were considered in contact when their distance was &#x003C; 6 &#x00C5;, and residue contacts were calculated by summing all bead or atom contacts. The following residues were considered to be part of the constant, variable, transmembrane and cytosolic domains for the TCR chains: TCR&#x03B1; variable: 1-106, constant: 107-198, transmembrane: 199-246, cytosolic: 247-249. TCR&#x03B2; variable: 1-117, constant: 118-245, transmembrane: 246-285, cytosolic: 286-293. The polar plots were calculated by setting the center of geometry of the TCR&#x03B2; as the origin, and by representing the CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B3;</sup> and CD3&#x03B5;<sup>&#x03B4;</sup> chains by their centers of geometry. Centers of geometry were calculated using both backbone and side-chain beads (coarse-grained simulations) or atoms (atomistic simulations).

<title>Objective</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated two glycines (G240 and G245) in the TCR&#x03B2; connecting peptide. We generated three NFAT-GFP reporter T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> that express 3A9 TCR as model systems. One expressed a wild-type (GG) 3A9 TCR connecting peptide and the other two expressed mutated hinge regions at G240 and G245 with either alanine (AA) or proline (PP). T cells were co-incubated with antigen presenting cells and cognate peptide, and cell activation was evaluated by measuring GFP expression using flow cytometry.</p>
