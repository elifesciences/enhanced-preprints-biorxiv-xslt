<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The circadian clock enables anticipation of the day/night cycle in animals ranging from cnidarians to mammals. Circadian rhythms are generated through a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) involving negative and positive factors. CLOCK is a central conserved positive factor in the animal kingdom. However, the functional evolutionary origin and mechanism of action of CLOCK in basal animals are unknown. In cnidarians, the transcription of putative core clock genes, including <italic>Clock</italic>, is arrhythmic under constant conditions, and it is unclear how the TTFL model can regulate physiological rhythms. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate a <italic>Clock</italic> mutant (<italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. High-throughput video tracking of locomotor activity in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> adults revealed that light regulates rhythmic behavior, while CLOCK maintains a 24-hour circadian rhythm under constant light conditions, and even under a 6-hour cycle, reminiscent of the tidal rhythm. Transcriptome profiling identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> adults, particularly genes involved in cell cycle and neural development. In accordance with the rhythmic behavioral profile, computational analysis revealed rhythmic and arrhythmic gene expression in wild-type and <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> adults, respectively, under constant dark conditions. Notably, hierarchal light- and <italic>Clock-</italic>signaling is required to drive rhythmic transcription of the core clock genes. These findings demonstrate that CLOCK has evolved in cnidarians to maintain synchronized 24-hour rhythmic physiology and behavior despite the chaotic inputs of environmental cues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the history of life on Earth, organisms have had to adapt to a constantly changing environment, including the &#x223C;24-hour daily rhythm of light/dark, driving the development of endogenous biological clocks. The circadian clock, which is entrained by external stimuli such as light, enables the organism to anticipate the onset of the light and dark phases and synchronize its physiology and behavior in harmony with the environment. This, in turn, enhances the organism&#x2019;s fitness and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. From single-celled organisms to metazoans, circadian clocks have evolved multiple times, highlighting their importance to living organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Despite the fundamental role circadian clocks play in regulating the biorhythmicity of living organisms, their evolutionary origin and intricate molecular mechanisms remain ambiguous in early diverging animal lineages, such as cnidaria.</p>
<p>Rhythmic phenomena, including calcification, reproduction, and diel behavior patterns, have been examined in cnidarian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While some of these patterns were found to be directly triggered by environmental stimuli, such as light, others persist in the absence of external cues, suggesting the presence of an internally generated and self-sustaining circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, cnidarians possess homologs of putative core clock genes found in bilaterians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown that most of these genes display diel expression patterns under light/dark cycles. However, in contrast to most animals, their oscillation generally ceases without the presence of light cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, how the core clock genes orchestrate rhythmic gene expression and circadian behaviors in cnidarians remains unclear.</p>
<p>One of the most studied cnidarian species in the field of chronobiology is the estuarine sea anemone, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Few studies have shown that in diel lighting, the locomotor behavior of <italic>N. vectensis</italic> has a &#x223C;24-h rhythm that is maintained under constant conditions suggesting it is regulated by an endogenous circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In accordance, the <italic>N. vectensis</italic> genome codes for conserved core clock genes such as <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Cycle</italic>, <italic>Timeout</italic>, and the cryptochromes <italic>Cry1a</italic> and <italic>Cry1b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The proposed circadian clock model in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> is composed of the positive transcription factors, CLOCK and CYCLE, that heterodimerize and upregulate light-dependent cryptochrome genes in the feedback loop, and PAR-bZIPs in the feed-forward loop, which repress the transcription of the positive elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. More recently, the clock-interacting pacemaker, CIPC was predicted to act as an additional repressor of the CLOCK:CYCLE dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, in contrast to the free running oscillation demonstrated for <italic>N. vectensis</italic> behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, transcriptional expression profiles of most candidate genes implicated in the core clock mechanism do not retain their oscillation period in the absence of light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system to establish a <italic>Clock</italic> mutant (<italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. Using behavioral monitoring and transcriptomic analysis, we studied the role of CLOCK in regulating rhythmic locomotor activity and gene expression under various light regimes. The findings show evolutionary conserved roles for CLOCK and suggest that <italic>Clock</italic> has evolved to modulates the ancient hierarchy between light- and circadian clock-regulated physiology and behavior.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis and spatial expression of <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA in <italic>N. vectensis</italic></title>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis of CLOCK protein sequences showed that it is positioned within the cnidarian branch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar to the protein structure found in other animals, it contains a basic helix&#x2013;loop&#x2013;helix (bHLH) DNA binding domain and two Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. PAS domains have been shown as important structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions that drive the self-sustaining molecular mechanism underlying the circadian clock. To localize <italic>Clock</italic> expression in the cellular and tissue levels, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization chain reaction (HCRv.3) was performed using probe designed to target the <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA. In WT juvenile four-tentacle stage, low clock expression was observed throughout the animal tissue, and enriched expression was visible in the tentacle endodermis and mesenteries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This expression pattern resembled the expression observed at late planula stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Notably, the HCR technique enables to detect low number of transcripts at cellular resolution. Although the expression of <italic>Clock</italic> was low, <italic>Clock</italic> transcripts localized in discrete subcellular regions in the nuclei and soma (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results characterize the spatial expression of <italic>Clock</italic> with a cellular resolution in the polyp, however, to date, functional manipulation of the <italic>Clock</italic> gene has not been performed in early animal lineages including cnidarians, and its function is unknown in cnidarians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the function of CLOCK, we utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a stable <italic>Clock</italic> mutant <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. The CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA), designed to target a region close to the 5&#x2019;-end of the <italic>Clock</italic> coding sequence (CDS), was synthesized, and microinjected with the endonuclease Cas9 into zygotes (Methods). F0 animals were outcrossed with WT and the F1 progeny were raised to adulthood. Subsequently, F1 animals harboring mutation at the <italic>Clock</italic> locus were identified by genotyping using DNA extracted from bisected physa. We identified 10 different alleles, 6 with a frame-shift mutation including one of 20 bp (<italic>Clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></italic>), resulting in a premature stop codon (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The predicted 203 amino acid truncated protein lacked 459 amino acids including one co-factor dimerization PAS domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To obtain <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> homozygous animals, we crossed <italic>Clock1</italic><sup>&#x002B;/-</sup> F1 animals. Genotyping F2 animals resulted in the expected 25&#x0025; <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals. Next, we intercrossed <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals to obtain F3 <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> that were used in subsequent experiments, aiming to assess the role of CLOCK in regulating diel behavioral and genetic rhythms.</p>

<title><italic>Clock</italic> is necessary to maintain circadian behavior</title>
<p>Our behavior tracking analysis showed that the locomotor activity of both WT and <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> has a periodicity of 24h (p&#x003C;0.01) under 12h light: 12h dark (LD) cycles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d-d</xref>&#x2019;, Supplementary Table 1). Next, to determine whether the <italic>Clock</italic> mutation influences free-running locomotor oscillations, animals were monitored under constant conditions i.e., continuous dark (DD) or continuous light (LL). We discovered that WT animals maintained the rhythmic behavior with a 22h (p&#x003C;0.01) periodicity. In contrast, the locomotor activity of <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> was arrhythmic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1e-e</xref>&#x2019; and Fig.1f-f&#x2019;, Supplementary Table 1). To further explore the rhythmicity of <italic>N. vectensis</italic> under LD, we tracked the locomotor activity under a 6h light: 6h dark (LD 6:6) cycle after a 72h entrainment under 12:12 LD. We found that the WT behavior maintained a weak but significant periodicity of 22h (p&#x003C;0.01). Interestingly, the <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> showed a clear rhythmic behavior with a 12h period (p&#x003C;0.01), pointing towards direct light-dependency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1g-g</xref>&#x2019;). However, to rule out the effect of a potential endogenous circatidal clock, we entrained the animals under LD 6:6 and tracked their behavior under DD. We found that the WT maintained a free-running periodicity of 22h (p&#x003C;0.01), while the <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> were arrhythmic (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title><italic>Clock</italic> mutation causes a broad impact on the rhythmic transcriptome</title>
<p>To investigate the underlying molecular correlate of the arrhythmic behavior phenotype found in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, transcriptional profiling was conducted on WT and <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals that were sampled in 4h intervals over 24h under LD and DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Using the RAIN (rhythmicity analysis incorporating non-parametric methods) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we identified in the WT 2262 genes rhythmic under LD and 2361 rhythmic genes under DD (p&#x003C; 0.05). In <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, we detected 1847 rhythmic genes under LD and 1314 under DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Overall, we detected 6200/6803 (91.1&#x0025;) genes with no overlap between genotypes, 3798 (55.8&#x0025;) genes specific to the WT, and 2402 (35.3&#x0025;) genes to <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, revealing that the <italic>Clock</italic> mutation has a broad impact on the rhythmic transcriptome (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). To investigate genes strictly under the control of the circadian clock we crossed the two WT gene lists (LD and DD) and obtained 220 genes rhythmic in both LD and DD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Table 3), we refer to them as clock-controlled genes (CCGs). A GO term analysis showed enrichment in regulation of different step of translation, transcription, and mitosis regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, Supplementary Table 4) which is coherent with the known function of the <italic>N. vectensis</italic> circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, 188/220 (85&#x0025;) of the CCGs were not rhythmic under LD nor DD. As such, we have designated them as <italic>Clock</italic>-dependent CCGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Next, we analyzed the <italic>Clock</italic>-dependent CCGs for DNA motif enrichment in their promoter, 1kb upstream of their ATG, and detected a significant enrichment in multiple E-box motif associated with bHLH circadian regulation such as CLOCK, BMAL1, and NPAS2 in 28&#x0025; of the genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Applying the same analytical methods, we discovered that in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, 125 out of 156 genes displayed rhythmic expression patterns under both LD and DD. These genes were arrhythmic in the WT animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> and Supplementary Table 3). As such, we have designated these genes as &#x201C;neoCCGs&#x201D;. We did not observe any significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related to circadian rhythms or the presence of circadian E-box motifs in the promoter regions of the neoCCGs. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-e</xref> and Supplementary Table 4).</p>

<title><italic>Clock</italic> cooperates with light to drive the transcription rhythm of the core clock genes</title>
<p>Consistent with previous finding in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, our rhythmic analysis of the eight core clock candidates showed that they are all arrhythmic under DD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and Supplementary Table 2). This finding was also true for the <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, however, we observed general altered expression patterns under LD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>PAR-bZIPc</italic> and <italic>Cry-b</italic> were found to be rhythmic only in WT LD, indicating that light is epistatic on <italic>Clock</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably, the only core clock member included in the <italic>Clock</italic>-dependent CCGs we identified, was <italic>CiPC</italic>, however, its individual expression pattern suggested that it is more likely a dampening factor rather than a true rhythmic clock gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Additionally, our analysis revealed that circadian E-box motifs were enriched in most of the core clock genes. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Given the limitations in using core clock genes mRNA as a true circadian clock marker, we sought to identify new markers that could accurately reflect the circadian rhythm. Through our analysis of the 188 <italic>Clock</italic>-dependent CCGs, we identified 16 genes that displayed rhythmic expression patterns in both our study and a previous study by Leach <italic>et al</italic>. (2019)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, Supplementary Table 5). Among these candidate markers, we selected <italic>Myh7</italic> due to its detectability through both RNA-seq and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization techniques. Furthermore, the spatial expression pattern of <italic>Myh7</italic> closely resembled that of <italic>Clock</italic>, as evidenced by our analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-f</xref>).</p>

<p>To further evaluate changes in gene expression between the genotypes caused by the <italic>Clock</italic> mutation, differentially expressed gene analysis was performed between genotypes for each light condition. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the Wald test with an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05.

In LD conditions, <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>N. vectensis</italic> showed 457 down-regulated genes and 646 up-regulated genes, without any significant GO term enrichment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, Supplementary Table 5-6).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study offers valuable insights into the evolutionary history of circadian clocks by demonstrating the effects of a loss-of-function <italic>Clock</italic> mutation in the basal metazoan, <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>. Through our behavioral assays, we have shown that the <italic>Clock</italic> gene is essential for maintaining rhythmic locomotor activity in the absence of an entraining light cue. These findings suggest that this fundamental aspect of circadian clocks was likely present in the common ancestor of both <italic>N. vectensis</italic> and bilaterian animals, shedding light on the evolution of this critical feature of animal biology. However, our transcriptomic data raises questions regarding the ancestral role of <italic>Clock</italic> in the central clock mechanism and its relationship with the environment.</p>
<p>Studies of homozygous <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> flies have shown that <italic>dClock</italic> has a dual role in generating circadian rhythms: as an essential core component of the molecular oscillator and in influencing the direct effects of light on locomotor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. WT flies under standard light-dark cycles anticipate the lights-on and lights-off transitions by slowly increasing activity, while this anticipatory response is obscured in arrhythmic <italic>dClock</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast to flies, CLOCK-deficient mice continue to express robust circadian rhythms in locomotor activity, although they do show altered responses to light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Overall, these findings suggest that CLOCK has different roles in the generation of circadian rhythms and in modulating responses to light in flies and mice. Interestingly, <italic>Bmal1</italic> is the only known mammalian clock gene whose inactivation results in immediate arrhythmicity at both the behavioral and molecular levels in the absence of external cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, since mammalian genes exist as multiple isoforms with partially overlapping functions, it was suggested that functional redundancy may obscure the phenotypic outcome in the case of other clock components, including <italic>mClock</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The results presented here are consistent with these previous findings, as observed in the complete loss of rhythmic circadian behavior in <italic>Clock<sup>-/-</sup> N. vectensis</italic> under free-running conditions. However, when exposed to LD cycles, we found that the period of rhythmic behavior in these mutants was light-dependent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-g</xref>), indicating that while the molecular oscillator in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> is disrupted, the light input pathway remains intact. Thus, <italic>Clock</italic> is essential for maintaining circadian behavior in the absence of an entraining cue; however, unlike <italic>dClock</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> or <italic>mMop3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (also known as BMAL1), it does not seem to play a functional role in the input pathway as it is not necessary for entraining or generating normal activity levels of behavior to LD cycles.</p>
<p>At the transcriptomic level, previous studies in <italic>N. vectensis</italic> have shown large shifts in the transcriptional profile of many genes after a single day of constant darkness, including the candidate core circadian genes that were found arrhythmic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, in our data, the rhythmic expression of these genes, including <italic>Clock</italic>, strongly depends on light-dark cycles while behavior and CCGs are still oscillating in free-running. One explanation for this inconsistency is that using whole animals for sampling material, as in vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, has the potential to mask oscillating gene expression signals, particularly if the signals are present in a small number of cells or If tissues have rhythmic gene expression in different phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that the core clock mechanism in cnidarians may differ from that of other animal groups, which could affect the intrinsic transcriptional rhythmicity. However, given the widespread expression pattern of <italic>Clock</italic> mRNA we detected, we chose to perform full animal sampling for our transcriptome analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though LD cycles are the main factor driving rhythmic expression, all eight core clock genes have an altered expression pattern in our <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This finding could suggest that <italic>Clock</italic> exerts a fine-tuning regulation on their light-dependent expression. However, while the actual contribution of the transcriptional oscillation of putative core clock genes to the oscillator, if any, remains indefinite, the observation of transcriptomic circadian oscillations and the identification of 125 neoCCGs in <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> raises further unexpected questions. The only study describing a similar phenomenon is in liver cells of <italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which exhibit circadian oscillations at the transcription, translation, and protein phosphorylation levels. The authors proposed that a non-canonical clock driven by ETS factors is functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in our data we did not retrieve any GO term enrichment, suggesting the neoCCGs are not recruited by the oscillator in a coordinated manner. Additionally, we did not identify circadian annotated E-box enrichment within their promoter, nor other binding motif enriched compared to the CCGs which could help identify which factors are responsible for these abnormal oscillations. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of an effect from the predicted truncated CLOCK protein, the rhythmic circadian behavior of the heterozygote <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/&#x002B;</sup> indicates there is no dominant-negative effect (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). From our results, it is apparent that a functional circadian oscillator persists in the absence of Clock, albeit with altered target genes. It appears that <italic>Clock</italic> is not essential for the core mechanism that drives molecular oscillations. However, the origin of these oscillations remains unclear, and further research is necessary to elucidate the evolutionary and mechanistic implications of our findings.</p>
<p>Our study revealed that the <italic>Clock</italic><sup>-/-</sup> gene exhibits significant differential expression when compared to the WT in LD and DD conditions. Interestingly in DD, the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in cell division and microtubule organization, which suggests a potential function of <italic>Clock</italic> in coordinating cellular processes beyond circadian rhythm. Conversely, the up-regulated genes were linked to sensory perception, indicating a potential novel role of <italic>Clock</italic> in regulating sensory processes. Overall, our findings suggest that <italic>Clock</italic> has non-circadian functions in a light-dependent context in <italic>N. vectensis</italic>, possibly related to developmental processes, as core clock genes are expressed and arrhythmic during planula stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Our study underscores the need to explore potential novel roles of circadian clock components beyond their established role in regulating the circadian rhythm of adult <italic>N. vectensis</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this study provides novel insights into circadian regulation in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> and sheds light on the evolutionary origin of circadian time maintenance. Our findings indicate that while <italic>Clock</italic> function is conserved from Cnidaria to mammals, it is not a core component of the TTFL. Our findings suggest that the CLOCK protein evolved to alter the light-biological clock hierarchy and facilitate the connection between the core oscillator and the organism, simplifying interactions with the environment. This opens new avenues for investigating cell-type-specific mechanisms of the circadian clock that drive the molecular and phenotypical oscillations of cnidarians. By further exploring the circadian clock mechanisms in cnidarians, we can gain deeper insights into the evolutionary origins of this critical aspect of biology, enhancing our understanding of how organisms have evolved to keep track of time and adapt to their environment.</p>

To ensure specificity of the gRNA, the selected target site sequence (GGTCCTCTCGTGGACTCTAC) was BLASTed against <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> genome (using JGI expected E value threshold of 0.1 to adjust for short sequences; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html">http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Nemve1/Nemve1.home.html</ext-link>).

<title>CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis screening</title>
<p>To evaluate genome editing efficiency and mosaicism in F0 animals, genomic DNA flanking the guide sequence was amplified and Sanger sequenced. PCR was performed using two strategies. For the first, PCR reactions were performed using individual injected <italic>N. vectensis</italic> (7-days post-fertilization), directly pipetted into a 25-&#x03BC;l PCR reaction containing a 2x concentration of PCR MasterMix (Tiangen) and 10 pmol of each PCR primer.

Image manipulation was performed with Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. For the double probes <italic>Clock</italic> imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1.B</xref>), ROIs were generated from each <italic>Clock</italic> probes and only the ROIs positive for the 2 fluorophores were kept. These ROIs were then used to extract from the original picture to select the signal considered as true mRNA signal. Figures were then assembled in Inkscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inkscape.org/">http://www.inkscape.org/</ext-link>)</p>

<caption><p>Clock cooperates with light to drive the transcription rhythm of the core clock genes.</p>
<p>(A) Each core clock gene is individually plotted showing the read count over 24h in LD and DD in WT (black) and Clock-/- (red). The continuous line represents significant rhythmicity (RAIN p&#x003C;0.05) while the dashed line indicates no rhythmicity. (B) The presence of Circadian E-box in all core clock gene promoters was detected using HOMER within 1000bp upstream ATG. (C) Conserved rhythmic genes were selected from our WT data and Leach et al., 2020. (D) The temporal expression pattern of Clockdownstream gene <italic>Myh7</italic> is shown.
