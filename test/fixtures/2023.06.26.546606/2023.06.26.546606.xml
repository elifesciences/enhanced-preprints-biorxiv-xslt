<title>Abstract</title><p>Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing and metabolism are two hallmarks of MYC-driven cancers. Pharmacological inhibition of both processes has been extensively investigated as potential therapeutic avenues in preclinical and clinical studies. However, how pre-mRNA splicing and metabolism are orchestrated in response to oncogenic stress and therapies is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that JMJD6 acts as a hub connecting splicing and metabolism in MYC-driven neuroblastoma. JMJD6 cooperates with MYC in cellular transformation by physically interacting with RNA binding proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing and protein homeostasis. Notably, JMJD6 controls the alternative splicing of two isoforms of glutaminase (GLS), namely kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC), which are rate-limiting enzymes of glutaminolysis in the central carbon metabolism in neuroblastoma. Further, we show that JMJD6 is correlated with the anti-cancer activity of indisulam, a &#x201C;molecular glue&#x201D; that degrades splicing factor RBM39, which complexes with JMJD6. The indisulam-mediated cancer cell killing is at least partly dependent on the glutamine-related metabolic pathway mediated by JMJD6. Our findings reveal a cancer-promoting metabolic program is coupled with alternative pre-mRNA splicing through JMJD6, providing a rationale to target JMJD6 as a therapeutic avenue for treating MYC-driven cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> which allows rapidly proliferating tumor cells to acquire nutrients to meet their bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and redox demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. One of the primary driving forces in reprograming cancer cell metabolism is the deregulated MYC family proto-oncogenes (<italic>C-MYC</italic>, <italic>MYCN,</italic> and <italic>MYCL</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, which are known to encode master transcriptional factors that regulate metabolic gene expression. MYC coordinates nutrient acquisition to produce ATP and key cellular building blocks that increase cell mass and promote DNA replication and cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The increase in total RNA and protein synthesis by overactive MYC signaling leads to dysregulation of macromolecular processing machineries including the spliceosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and consequently pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, another hallmark of MYC-driven cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, for the purpose of cellular stress adaptation. <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification is one of the most important biological features of high-risk neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Transgenic mouse and zebrafish models have demonstrated that MYCN is a neuroblastoma driver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In tumors without <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, <italic>C-MYC</italic> is overexpressed, further indicating that neuroblastoma is a MYC-driven cancer. The metabolic dependency of neuroblastoma has been widely studied by us and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. A larger number of splicing changes have also been noticed in high-stage neuroblastomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Splicing alterations lead to a spliceosomal vulnerability that provides a new opportunity to develop transformative therapies by disrupting aberrant pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We and others have shown that targeting the splicing factor RBM39 by indisulam, a &#x201C;molecular glue&#x201D; that bridges RBM39 to E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF15 for proteasomal degradation, achieved an exceptional anti-tumor activity in neuroblastoma models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Disruption of spliceosome by Pladienolide B also resulted in significant anti-tumor effect in neuroblastoma models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> However, how the dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing machinery and metabolism are orchestrated in MYC-driven neuroblastoma has not been well elucidated. Whether metabolism modulates the anti-cancer effect of splicing inhibition remains to be answered.</p>
<p>Next-generation sequencing studies have revealed only a few recurrent somatic mutations in neuroblastoma at the time of diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, copy number alterations of chromosomal segments such as 17q gain, 1p36 or 11q23 loss frequently occur in high-risk neuroblastoma. While attempts to understand the functions of individual genes in these chromosomal segments have been reported (i.e., BIRC5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, PHB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, PPM1D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, TRIM37<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> in 17q; ARID1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, CAMTA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, CASZ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, CHD5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, KIF1B&#x03B2;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, miR-34a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, RUNX3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> in 1p36), the biological consequences of these genetic events in MYC-driven tumors still remain largely unknown. Gain of 17q is the most frequent genetic event in high-risk neuroblastoma and is associated with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In addition, in the transgenic <italic>MYCN</italic> mouse model of neuroblastoma, the chromosomal locus syntenic to human 17q is partially amplified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, indicating that chromosome 17q is needed for MYC-mediated tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>JMJD6 is a JmjC domain&#x2013;containing nuclear protein with iron- and 2-oxoglutarate&#x2013;dependent dioxygenase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, whose coding gene is located on chromosome 17q25. While the histone arginine demethylase activity of JMJD6 that catalyzes demethylation of H4R3me1/me2 is controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, JMJD6 is a lysyl-5-hydroxylase that catalyzes 5-hydroxylation on specific lysine residues of target proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. JMJD6 has pleiotropic functions in normal physiology and in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We previously found that JMJD6 is essential for the survival of neuroblastoma cells (including <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified and <italic>C-MYC</italic>&#x2013; overexpressed cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, which was further validated by an independent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, indicating that neuroblastoma has JMJD6 dependency. However, the exact mechanism of JMJD6 in MYC-driven cancers remains elusive. One study has shown that JMJD6 and BRD4 co-bind at antipause enhancers, regulating promoter-proximal pause release of a large subset of transcription units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. By harnessing a similar mechanism, JMJD6 promotes cell survival of glioblastoma <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. These findings are particularly interesting because BRD4 occupies exceptionally large super-enhancers associated with genes, including <italic>C-MYC</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and the expression of those enhancers can be disrupted by BRD4 inhibitors, which have a potent antitumor effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Here we show a new mechanism by which JMJD6 promotes tumorigenesis mediated by the MYC oncogene in that JMJD6 interacts with a subset of RNA binding proteins including RBM39 in neuroblastoma cells and regulates the alternative splicing of metabolic genes that are involved in mitochondrial metabolism. &#x201C;Glutamine addiction&#x201D; is one key feature of MYC-driven tumors. Glutaminase (GLS) is the enzyme responsible for conversion of glutamine to glutamate in the process of glutaminolysis to feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and has two splice isoforms, GAC (glutaminase C) and KGA (kidney-type glutaminase). We show that JMJD6 controls the alternative splicing of KGA and GAC, and, consequently, impacts the central carbon metabolism in neuroblastoma. Further we show that JMJD6 is correlated with the anti-cancer activity of indisulam, a &#x201C;molecular glue&#x201D; that degrades the splicing factor RBM39. The indisulam-mediated cancer cell killing is at least partly dependent on the glutamine-related metabolic pathway mediated by JMJD6. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which JMJD6 coordinates metabolic programs and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, providing a rationale to target JMJD6 as a therapeutic target for MYC-driven cancers.</p>

<title>The essential genes for neuroblastoma cell survival on chromosome 17q target pre-mRNA splicing and metabolism</title>
<p>An incomplete understanding of the biological consequences of chromosome 17q gain remains a barrier to the understanding of high-risk neuroblastoma. 1132 genes are located on 17q (<bold>Supplementary table 1</bold>). We surmised that some of the 17q genes are particularly important for neuroblastoma cell survival. Analysis of the cancer dependency genes in neuroblastoma cell lines screened with the Avana sgRNA library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> revealed that 114 were essential to neuroblastoma (mean score &#x003C;-0.4) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary table 2</bold>). Protein interaction network analysis followed by functional annotation revealed that proteins encoded by these 114 essential genes formed distinct but interconnected modules including RNA splicing (i.e., SRSF2, DDX5, DDX42, DHX8), mitochondrial metabolism (i.e., NDUFA8, COX11, SLC25A10, SLC35B1), protein homeostasis (i.e., UBE2O, PSMB3, PSMC5), DNA repair (i.e., BRIP1, BRCA1, RAD51C, RAD51D) and transcriptional regulation (i.e., PHF12, CBX1, SMARCE1, MED1), as well as endocytosis (i.e., CHMP6, CTLC, EPN3, HGS, SNF8, VPS25) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). Using these 114 genes as a signature, we found that 81 of them were highly expressed in high-risk neuroblastomas, which were enriched with MYCN amplification (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>). Correspondingly, neuroblastomas with high expression levels of this gene signature were associated with a poorer event-free and overall survival of patients (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, e</xref></bold>). These data demonstrate that 17q genes are involved in essential biological processes and highly expressed in high-risk neuroblastomas.</p>

<title>JMJD6 is required for neuroblastoma growth</title>
<p><italic>JMJD6</italic> was among these 114 essential genes. To understand the role of JMJD6, we examined the genetic features of <italic>JMJD6</italic> in neuroblastoma and other types of cancers. Among the genes encoding JmjC-domain containing proteins, <italic>JMJD6</italic> was the only one that was frequently amplified in neuroblastoma (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). High <italic>JMJD6</italic> expression was associated with poor event-free outcome, as shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). To examine whether <italic>JMJD6</italic> amplification is limited to specific tumor types, we explored genomic data from different cancers using the cBioportal program. <italic>JMJD6</italic> was amplified across multiple types of adult cancers such as breast and liver cancer (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1a</bold>), and correlated with worse relapse-free survival (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1b</bold>). We further compared the RNA-seq expression of <italic>JMJD6</italic> in 2337 samples across over 20 pediatric cancer subtypes and found that <italic>JMJD6</italic> showed the highest expression levels in neuroblastoma (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1c</bold>), suggesting that JMJD6 might be particularly important in neuroblastoma. We validated this hypothesis using shRNA knockdown of JMJD6 in <italic>MYCN</italic> amplified cells (BE2C, SIMA, KELLY, IMR32) and non-<italic>MYCN</italic> amplified cells (SK-N-AS and CHLA20). The results showed that loss of JMJD6 greatly reduced the colony numbers in all tested cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>), demonstrating that JMJD6 is essential to neuroblastoma cells regardless of <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification. Neuroblastic tumors comprise a histologic spectrum that ranges from less-differentiated neuroblastoma to well-differentiated ganglioneuroma. The extent of differentiation in the tumor cells is correlated with prognostic significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. We noticed that the loss of JMJD6 led to neurite outgrowth (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1d</bold>), a unique structure of neuroblastoma cells differentiating <italic>in vitro</italic>. This morphologic change suggests that JMJD6 is required to maintain cancer cell stemness. Lastly, we validated that JMJD6 is essential to neuroblastoma growth in <italic>MYCN</italic> amplified (BE2C) and C-MYC overexpressed (SK-N-AS) xenograft models (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d, e</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of JMJD6 function impedes neuroblastoma cell survival and tumor growth.</p>

<title>JMJD6 promotes MYC-mediated cellular transformation</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether gain of function of JMJD6 could facilitate MYC-mediated oncogenic transformation. To test this, we used a NIH3T3 transformation assay that provides a straightforward method to assess the transforming potential of an oncogene, which may lead to morphological transformation and loss of contact inhibition, a typical feature of cellular transformation. Like the GFP control (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2a</bold>), we found that NIH3T3 cells with overexpressed JMJD6 stopped proliferation after being confluent (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2b</bold>), indicating JMJD6 alone is unable to transform NIH3T3 cells. However, overexpression of MYCN induced foci formation with enhanced cell death (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2c</bold>). Importantly, NIH3T3 cells with overexpressed MYCN and JMJD6 lost contact inhibition, accompanied with morphological change, and formed larger foci (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2d</bold>), indicating that JMJD6 enhances MYCN activity to transform NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, MYCN alone also reprogramed metabolism of NIH3T3 cells as shown by the color change of the media, indicative of acidic pH change, which was largely rescued by co-expression of JMJD6 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2e</bold>), suggesting that cells with enhanced lactate production by MYCN were directed to oxidative phosphorylation by JMJD6. It is believed that the cell of origin of neuroblastoma is the progeny of neural crest cells. We therefore tested the role of JMJD6 in MYC-mediated transformation using JoMa1, a cell line derived from murine neural crest, by transducing GFP, JMJD6, MYCN and JMJD6/MYCN (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref></bold>). While JMJD6 showed no difference from GFP control in regulating cell proliferation, MYCN slightly enhanced cell proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref></bold>). However, the combination of JMJD6 and MYCN remarkably increased cell proliferation, mirrored by the colony formation assay which showed JMJD6/MYCN induced rapid growth of colonies with distinct transformation morphology (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g, h</xref></bold>). Implantation of each group into immune-deficient mice led to tumor development of MYCN and JMJD6/MYCN groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i</xref></bold>). However, JMJD6/MYCN group tumors appeared to grow faster than the MYCN alone tumors. Taken together, these data indicate that JMJD6 enhances the MYC-mediated transformation, demonstrating the oncogenic role of JMJD6.</p>

<title>JMJD6 regulates pathways engaged in pre-mRNA splicing and mitochondrial biogenesis in neuroblastoma</title>
<p>We surmised that loss of function of genes in the same functional module/pathway may induce similar effects across different cell lineages, which in turn corroborates the hypothesis that JMJD6 is a player in that signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the dependency correlation of <italic>JMJD6</italic> knockout and other genes (defined as co-dependency genes if they are positively correlated), by using the DepMap data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org">https://depmap.org</ext-link>) that includes genome-wide knockout in 1027 cell lines of more than 20 cancer types (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>), followed by pathway enrichment. The data showed that JMJD6 co-dependency genes were significantly and positively correlated with spliceosome/mRNA splicing (i.e., RBM39, SF3B1), ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and endocytosis and a number of 17q25 genes, (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a, c</xref></bold>), which mirrored the pathway network of 17q essential genes in neuroblastoma (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). JMJD6 knockout was negatively correlated with the knockout of genes housed at chromosome 1p, which is frequently deleted in high-risk neuroblastoma, and oxidative phosphorylation as well as protein translation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b, d</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>BRD4 is known to regulate MYC expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that JMJD6 and BRD4 interact to regulate gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, suggesting that JMJD6 might directly modulate MYC expression. To assess this possibility, we knocked down <italic>JMJD6</italic> in neuroblastoma cell lines BE2(C) and SK-N-AS, which express <italic>MYCN</italic> and <italic>C-MYC</italic>, respectively, for RNA-seq analysis. The sequencing data were analyzed for differential gene expression (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Interestingly, loss of JMJD6 showed minimal impact on expression of <italic>MYCN</italic> in BE2C cells or <italic>C-MYC</italic> in SK-N-AS cells (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3a</bold>), and western blot analysis did not show alteration of MYCN expression although C-MYC protein was slightly downregulated by loss of JMJD6 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3b</bold>). However, BRD4 inhibitors drastically inhibited both MYCN and C-MYC expression in neuroblastoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, suggesting that JMJD6 inhibition has a distinct effect from the BRD4 inhibition. Gene set enrichment analysis for pathway engagement for the genes commonly downregulated or upregulated in both cell lines revealed that loss of JMJD6 most significantly repressed the expression of genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing, histones, and cell cycle G1/S checkpoint (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>), and enhanced the pathways involved in mitochondrial functions and heat shock response (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>). Interestingly, the genes transcribed from the mitochondrial genome were elevated in both cell lines (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3c</bold>), suggesting that JMJD6 directly or indirectly regulates the transcription of mitochondrial genome. These data are consistent with the co-dependency pathways of JMJD6 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-d</xref></bold>). Depletion of JMJD6 in both cell lines led to the downregulation of MYC signaling pathways (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>), although ranked behind the pathways of splicing and metabolism, suggesting that the MYC pathways are not primarily regulated by JMJD6. These data indicate that JMJD6 does not regulate the gene expression of the MYC family of transcription factors but might indirectly regulate the MYC pathway.</p>
<p>To verify if JMJD6 regulates pre-mRNA splicing, we analyzed the RNA-seq using two algorithms. The first one is event-based analysis to identify the altered exon splicing (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>). We found that knockdown of JMJD6 dominantly affects the exon skipping (SE) although other splicing events were also altered, albeit with a much smaller number (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>). Pathway analysis of common events in both BE2C and SK-N-AS cells demonstrated that genes involved in metabolism and splicing are the most significantly affected by loss of function of JMJD6 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref></bold>). Using the second algorithm of RNA splicing analysis previously developed (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref></bold>) that allows discovery of new isoforms of genes generated through alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, we identified 580 genes in BE2C cells and 1018 genes in SK-N-AS cells undergoing alternative splicing after JMJD6 knockdown, 133 of which were shared by both (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 5</bold>). The alternatively spliced genes were involved in a variety of pathways (<bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the 133 commonly alternatively spliced genes showed that only metabolic pathway genes were significantly enriched (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>), most of which are involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and folate metabolism (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that JMJD6 regulates RNA splicing of genes engaged in mitochondrial metabolism, being one of the key mediators of the 17q locus activity in neuroblastoma.</p>

The pre-mRNA splicing altered by JMJD6 knockdown included <italic>GLS</italic>, the key enzyme of glutaminolysis, prompting us to investigate the <italic>GLS</italic> splicing mediated by JMJD6 knockdown. GLS is known to catalyze the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, and is alternatively spliced to form two isoforms, GAC and KGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, with different cellular localization and catalytic capacities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The GAC isoform is more frequently upregulated in cancer cells than KGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and has been shown to be regulated by MYC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, leading to a &#x201C;glutamine addiction&#x201D; phenotype in MYC-driven tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. We found that loss of JMJD6 led to a splicing switch from the GAC isoform (with exons 1-15) to the KGA isoform (with exons 1-14 and 16-19) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>), which was further confirmed by isoform-specific RT PCR (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>). We then investigated the expression of GAC/KGA at the protein levels after JMJD6 knockdown. Western blot showed that the KGA isoform was increased after JMJD6 knockdown in all three tested cell lines, SK-N-AS, BE2C and SIMA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref></bold>). Then we further validated the JMJD6 effect on GLS isoform expression by using a luciferase reporter that indicates the isoforms of GAC and KGA. Indeed, JMJD6 knockdown significantly increased the expression of the KGA reporter (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref></bold>). RNA-immunoprecipitation showed that JMJD6 bound to <italic>GLS</italic> RNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref></bold>), suggesting that JMJD6 may directly regulate the splicing of <italic>GLS</italic>. We reasoned that if the regulation of <italic>GLS</italic> splicing by JMJD6 was a bone fide mechanism, the expression levels of <italic>JMJD6</italic> would correlate with the levels of <italic>GAC/KGA</italic> in tumors. Indeed, <italic>JMJD6</italic> was positively correlated with <italic>GAC</italic> and negatively correlated with <italic>KGA</italic> in two independent neuroblastoma cohorts (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref></bold>), supporting the hypothesis that JMJD6 is required to maintain the high ratio of <italic>GAC</italic>/<italic>KGA</italic> in cancer cells by controlling their alternative splicing.

However, introduction of either GAC or KGA in BE2C cells or SKNAS cells promoted colony formation (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h, i</xref></bold>), indicating that enhanced glutaminolysis by either GAC or KGA overexpression is pro-proliferative by gaining more ATPs.</p>

<title>JMJD6 forms an interaction network with proteins involved in splicing and protein synthesis</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism of JMJD6 in regulating splicing in neuroblastoma, we performed an unbiased identification of JMJD6 interacting partners by introducing a flag-tagged JMJD6 into SK-N-AS and BE2C cells, followed by immunoprecipitation to pull down the JMJD6 associated complex and protein identification with mass spectrometry (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, Supplementary Table 7</bold>). We found that JMJD6 mainly interacted with two classes of proteins which are involved in RNA splicing and protein synthesis in both cell lines, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, Supplementary Figure 6</bold>). We then validated the interactions of JMJD6 with splicing factors using immunoprecipitation and western blot, and demonstrated JMJD6 formed a complex with these RNA binding proteins, including RBM39 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>), a therapeutic target of high-risk neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

<p>Then we determined if the splicing factors interacting with JMJD6 also regulate GLS isoform expression.

We validated the function of CPSF6 in neuroblastoma cells and found that, indeed, loss of CPSF6 led to a dramatic switch from GAC to KGA in BE2C and SK-N-AS cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d, 5e</xref></bold>).

<title>JMJD6 regulates production of TCA intermediates and nucleoside triphosphate</title>
<p>To further dissect the biological consequences of loss of function of JMJD6, we created stable JMJD6 knockout clones (<bold>Supplementary Figure 7</bold>) and defined the metabolite spectrum affected by loss of function by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). JMJD6 knockout greatly reduced the production of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates (i.e., oxoglutarate, fumarate) and nucleoside triphosphate (ATP, CTP, GTP) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>), indicating that JMJD6 is a key bioenergetics regulator in cancer cells. Pathway analysis revealed that the reduced metabolites were involved in the Warburg effect, TCA, pentose phosphate pathway, and mitochondrial electron transport chain (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref></bold>), all of which are critical for providing cancer cell bioenergetics for proliferation and survival. Oxoglutarate (&#x03B1;-ketoglutarate) and fumarate are downstream products of glutaminolysis (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref></bold>). We reasoned that cellular metabolites such as glutamate and oxoglutarate may predict the cytotoxic effect of loss-of-function of JMJD6. If cells have higher levels of glutamate and oxoglutarate, they might be less dependent on JMJD6 due to their higher capacity of buffering against reduced glutaminolysis. To test this hypothesis, we used DepMap data that included 225 metabolites in 928 cancer cell lines from over 20 lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, and analyzed the correlation of each metabolite with <italic>JMJD6</italic> gene dependency. The data showed that cells with high levels of AMP, glutamate, alanine, 2-hydroxyglutarate and 2-oxoglutarate were more resistant to JMJD6 knockout, while cells with high levels of lactose and sucrose were more sensitive to JMJD6 knockout (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>, Supplementary Table 8</bold>). High levels of AMP activate AMP kinase (AMPK), consequently leading to enhanced fatty acid oxidation to stimulate ATP production while alanine can be converted to pyruvate to provide acetyl-CoA to fuel the TCA cycle (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref></bold>). Therefore, high levels of AMP and alanine may provide cells alternative bioenergetics sources for survival. These data further indicate that JMDJ6 function is wired into the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism.</p>

<title>JMJD6 determines the efficacy of indisulam, a molecular glue degrading splicing factor RBM39</title>
<p>Dysregulated splicing as a vulnerability of MYC-driven cancers provides a rationale to target neuroblastoma by using splicing inhibitors as a therapeutic approach. We and others have recently reported that indisulam, a &#x201C;molecular glue&#x201D; that selectively degrades the splicing factor RBM39, is exceptionally effective at causing tumor regression in multiple high-risk neuroblastoma models without overt toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, suggesting indisulam has translational potential. Understanding the factors determining the efficacy of indisulam or any other drug is critical for developing precision therapy, combination therapy or preventing therapy resistance. In addition to complexing together (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref></bold>), JMJD6 and RBM39 exhibit significant correlation of co-dependency in cancer cells, namely, cancer cells have similar dependency on JMJD6 and RBM39 for survival (<bold>Supplementary Table 3, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref></bold>). These data indicate that JMJD6 may play a role in modulating the effect of indisulam. To test this hypothesis, we performed GSEA to identify the differential pathways between indisulam-sensitive and indisulam-less sensitive neuroblastoma cells. It turned out that histone lysine demethylase (HDM) genes including JMJD6 are the in the only gene signature that is significantly enriched in indisulam-sensitive cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b, c, d</xref></bold>). Indeed, knockout of JMJD6 led to partial but significant resistance to indisulam treatment of SK-N-AS cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e-g</xref></bold>) and BE2C cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7h-j</xref></bold>), supporting that cells with high JMJD6 expression are more dependent on RBM39. Since we found that JMJD6 plays a key role in modulating glutaminolysis, we tested if expression of GAC or KGA could affect the activity of indisulam. Interestingly, overexpression of either GAC and KGA renders BE2C and SK-N-AS cells more resistant to indisulam treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7k-n</xref></bold>), suggesting that enhanced glutaminolysis may confer therapeutic resistance to spliceosome inhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MYC is an oncogenic driver of many types of cancer and plays a pivotal role in regulating glycolysis, glutaminolysis, nucleotide and lipid synthesis, and ribosome and mitochondrial biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Recent studies have revealed that there is also an interplay between MYC and pre-mRNA splicing machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential biological process catalyzed by the spliceosome to produce mature mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Over 90&#x0025; of multiexon genes in the human genome undergo alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, which significantly expands the diversity of the proteome and consequently impacts various biological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that the chromosome 17q locus, which is frequently gained in MYC-driven cancers, houses numerous genes essential to cancer cell survival that are implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome and mitochondrial biogenesis and other biological functions. Particularly, JMJD6, which is located on 17q25 and is amplified in a number of cancer types, physically interacts with a subset of splicing factors such as RBM39 and regulates the alternative splicing of metabolic genes. Depletion of JMJD6 inhibits cancer cell proliferation and impedes tumor growth while overexpression of JMJD6 promotes MYC-mediated tumorigenesis, suggesting that JMJD6 and potentially other 17q genes have oncogenic functions in cellular transformation. Previous studies suggest that JMJD6 and BRD4 interact to regulate gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. However, our unbiased identification of the JMJD6 interactome only identified a subset of proteins involved in mRNA splicing and protein translation in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that JMD6 may predominantly regulate protein homeostasis to facilitate MYC-mediated transformation. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that our immunoprecipitation conditions were too harsh, leading to dissociation of proteins that loosely or dynamically bind to JMJD6.</p>
<p>MYC-induced metabolic reprogramming triggers cellular dependency on exogenous glutamine as a source of carbon for mitochondrial membrane potential maintenance and macromolecular synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, leading to &#x201C;glutamine addiction&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Glutaminolysis is a process by which GLS and GLS2 convert glutamine to glutamate, which is, in turn, converted by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminase to 2-oxoglutarate that is further catabolized in the TCA cycle. Additionally, glutamate is a substrate for production of glutathione, an important antioxidant. We previously showed that neuroblastoma relies on MYCN-induced glutaminolysis for survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In this study, our RNA-seq barely detected the expression of <italic>GLS2</italic> in the neuroblastoma cell models we used, indicating that GLS is the major enzyme that catalyzes glutamine in these model systems. <italic>GLS</italic> has two isoforms, <italic>GAC</italic> and <italic>KGA</italic>, resulting from alternative splicing. KGA is mainly localized in the cytoplasm while GAC is localized in mitochondria and has a higher basal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. <italic>GAC</italic> mRNA levels strongly correlate with the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, as a proxy for GAC activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. The positive correlation of <italic>JMJD6</italic> and <italic>GAC</italic> suggests that the JMJD6-high tumors have enhanced glutaminolysis activity. CSPF6 and the noncoding RNA <italic>CCAT2</italic> have been reported to regulate the splicing of GLS isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that depletion of JMJD6 leads to a <italic>GLS</italic> isoform switch from <italic>GAC</italic> to <italic>KGA</italic>, indicating that JMJD6 is involved in alternative splicing of <italic>GLS</italic>. We further found that JMJD6 physically interacts with CPSF6 in a splicing network and validated that loss of CPSF6 results in remarkable induction of the KGA isoform. We further validated that other splicing factors such as U2AF2 also interact with JMJD6 to regulate the GLS isoform switch. These data indicate that cancer cells can adjust metabolism through alternative splicing to produce enzymes with distinct subcellular localization and activity that promote cellular transformation or progression of an oncogenic phenotype. The cooperation of JMJD6 and MYC in cellular transformation further supports the hypothesis that JMJD6 is needed for metabolic reprogramming triggered by MYC. However, overexpression of either GAC or KGA promotes cell proliferation, suggesting that the switching of KGA/GAC is a cellular fitness mechanism in response to interruption of the spliceosome by adjusting the metabolic rate. Within the tumor microenvironment (i.e., replete and deplete oxygen and nutrient supply) GLS activity is possibly finely tuned through splicing mechanism for adaption.</p>
<p>Additionally, we found that JMJD6 physically interacts with a subset of ribosomal proteins that are responsible for protein translation. Interestingly, overexpression of JMJD6 reduces global protein synthesis. A recent study showed that MYC overactivation leads to proteotoxic stress in cells by enhancing global protein synthesis, consequently causing cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. The increased global protein synthesis by MYC needs to be buffered through loss of DDX3X, a regulator of ribosome biogenesis and global protein synthesis, for lymphomagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that, besides the functions in regulating alternative splicing for metabolism, JMJD6 is involved in MYC-mediated cell transformation by buffering unwanted proteotoxic stress due to high rate of protein synthesis induced by MYC (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Overactive MYC drives high-load of gene transcription, enhanced protein synthesis and high rate of metabolism, leading to detrimental cellular stresses and consequent cell death (<bold>Model a</bold>). However, when 17q is amplified, high levels of JMJD6 and other proteins encoded by 17q genes physically interacts with the splicing and translational machineries, enhancing pre-mRNA splicing of metabolic genes such as GLS and inhibiting global protein synthesis, respectively, leading to reduced detrimental stresses and enhanced cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis (<bold>Model b</bold>). The high levels of JMJD6 predicts high dependency of RBM39, which are more sensitive to indisulam treatment.</p>

<p>Neuroblastoma is responsible for as much as 15&#x0025; of childhood cancer mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. With current intensive multimodal therapies, 5-year survival rates for high-risk patients remain less than 50&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. In addition, survivors of high-risk disease have a significant risk of developing long-term side effects including subsequent malignant neoplasms due to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, developing effective precision therapies against high-risk neuroblastoma has been challenging due to the lack of targetable recurrent mutations in neuroblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. Our previous study showed that indisulam, the splicing inhibitor that targets RBM39, a JMJD6-interacting partner, induced a durable complete response in multiple high-risk neuroblastoma models, supporting its potential use in future clinical trials. Our current study showed that JMJD6 expression is positively correlated with the effect of indisulam, and knockout of JMJD6 confers resistance to indisulam treatment. In line with the biological functions of JMDJ6 in regulating GLS isoform expression and mitochondrial metabolism, overexpression of GAC or KGA also caused resistance to indisulam treatment. These data indicate that JMJD6 could serve as a biomarker that predicts response to indisulam or other splicing inhibitors.</p>

<title>RNA-immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>SK-N-AS cells expressing Flag-JMJD6 were grown in a 10-cm dish in RPMI complete media. After 70&#x0025; confluency, cells were washed with cold PBS twice and then were subject to lysis with Polysome Lysis Buffer (100mM KCl, 5mM MgCl<sup>2</sup>, 10mM HEPES, pH7.0, 0.5&#x0025; NP-40, 1mM DTT, 100 U/ml RAasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, N2511), 2mM vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes solution (Sigma, 94742), 25&#x03BC;L protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells (Sigma, P8340)). Cell lysates were precleared with magnetic IgG beads for 1 hour. The cell lysates were subject to immunoprecipitation using M2 anti-Flag beads (Sigma, M8823) overnight by rocking at 4&#x00B0;C. The same amounts of lysates were saved at -80&#x00B0;C for input RNA extraction. The beads were washed with 250 &#x03BC;L Polysome Lysis Buffer for 4 times, flowed by washing with Polysome Lysis Buffer containing 1M urea. RNA was released by adding 150&#x03BC;L of Polysome Lysis Buffer containing 0.1&#x0025; SDS and 45&#x03BC;g protease K (Ambion, AM2548) and incubated at 50&#x00B0;C for 30min. RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture (Sigma, 77618). RNA was recovered by adding 2&#x03BC;L of GlycoBlue (15mg/ml, Ambion, AM9516), 36&#x03BC;L of 3M sodium acetate and 750&#x03BC;L ethanol followed by incubation at -20&#x00B0;C for overnight. RNA was precipitated with 70&#x0025; ethanol and air dried, followed by resuspension with RNase-free water followed by DNaseI (Promega, M6101) treatment to remove genomic DNA. The resultant RNAs were subjected to RT-qPCR analysis using 3 sets of GAC and KGA primers and 18S rRNA as control. 18S rRNA F: GCTTAATTTGACTCAACACGGGA; 18S rRNA R: AGCTATCAATCTGTCAATCCTGTC.

<title>Identification of JMJD6 interacting partners by LC-MS/MS</title>
<p>Protein samples were run on a short gel as described in a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. Proteins in the gel bands were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) and alkylated by iodoacetamide (IAA) (Sigma). The gel bands were then washed, dried, and rehydrated with a buffer containing trypsin (Promega). Samples were digested overnight, acidified and the resulting peptides were extracted. The extracts were dried and reconstituted in 5&#x0025; formic acid. The peptide samples were loaded on a nanoscale capillary reverse phase C18 column by a HPLC system (Thermo EASY-nLC 1000) and eluted by a gradient. The eluted peptides were ionized and detected by a mass spectrometer (Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Elite). The MS and MS/MS spectra were collected over a 90-min liquid chromatography gradient. Database searches were performed using Sequest (version 28 revision 13) search engine against a composite target / decoy Uniprot human protein database. All matched MS/MS spectra were filtered by mass accuracy and matching scores to reduce protein false discovery rate to &#x003C;1&#x0025;. Spectral counts, matching to individual proteins reflect their relative abundance in one sample after the protein size is normalized.

<p>MJD6 knockout or parental SK-N-AS cells were cultured in 6-well plates to &#x223C;85&#x0025; confluence and washed with 2 mL ice cold 1X Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS). The cells were then harvested in 300 &#x00B5;L freezing 80&#x0025; acetonitrile (v/v) into 1.5 mL tubes and lysed in the presence of 0.5mm Zirconia/silica beads by Bullet Blender (Next Advance) at 4 &#x00B0;C until the sample were homogenized. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 5 min and the supernatant was dried by speedvac. The samples were resuspended in 50 &#x00B5;L of 1&#x0025; acetonitrile plus 0.1&#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid, and separated by Ultra-C18 Micro spin columns (Harvard apparatus) into hydrophilic metabolites (flow through) and hydrophobic metabolites (eluent of 125 &#x00B5;L of 80&#x0025; acetonitrile plus 0.1&#x0025; trifluoroacetic acid). Ten &#x00B5;L of hydrophilic metabolites were dried, reconstituted in 3 &#x00B5;L of 66&#x0025; acetonitrile and analyzed by a ZIC-HILIC column (150 &#x00D7; 2.1 mm, EMD Millipore) coupled with a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher) in negative mode and metabolites were eluted within a 45 min gradient (buffer A: 10mM ammonium acetate in 90&#x0025; acetonitrile (pH&#x003D;8); buffer B: 10mM ammonium acetate in 100&#x0025; H<sup>2</sup>O (pH&#x003D;8)). Twenty &#x00B5;L of hydrophobic metabolites were dried and resuspend in 3 &#x00B5;L of 5&#x0025; formic acid followed by separation with a self-packed nanoC18 column (75 &#x03BC;m &#x00D7; 15 cm with 1.9 &#x00B5;m C18 resin from Dr. Maisch GmbH) and detection with a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher) in positive mode. Metabolites were eluted within a 50 min gradient (buffer A: 0.2&#x0025; formic acid in H<sup>2</sup>O; buffer B: 0.2&#x0025; formic acid in acetonitrile). MS settings for both types of samples included MS1 scans (120,000 resolution, 100-1000 <italic>m/z</italic>, 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> AGC and 50 ms maximal ion time) and 20 data-dependent MS2 scans (30,000 resolution, 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> AGC, &#x223C;45 ms maximal ion time, HCD, Stepped NCE (50, 100, 150), and 20 s dynamic exclusion). A mix of all samples served as quality control was injected in the beginning, middle and the end of the samples to monitor the signal stability of the instrument. The data analysis was performed by a recently developed software suite JUMPm. Raw files were converted to mzXML format followed by peak feature detection for individual sample and feature alignment across samples. Metabolite identification was supported by matching the retention time, accurate mass/charge (m/z) ratio, and MS/MS fragmentation data to our in-house authentic compound library and the matching of m/z and MS/MS fragmentation data to, downloaded experimental MS/MS library (MoNA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/">https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/</ext-link>), in-silico database generated from Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), and mzCloud (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mzcloud.org">https://mzcloud.org</ext-link>). Peak intensities were used for metabolite quantification. The data was normalized by both cell numbers (before data collection) and trimmed median intensity of all features across samples (post data collection).</p>

<title>Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for RNA-seq experiments</title>
<p>Total RNA from cells and tumor tissues were performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Paired-end sequencing was performed using the High-Seq platform with 100bp read length. Total stranded RNA sequencing data were processed by the internal AutoMapper pipeline. Briefly the raw reads were firs trimmed (Trim-Galore version 0.60), mapped to human genome assembly (GRCh38) (STAR v2.7) and then the gene level values were quantified (RSEM v1.31) based on GENCODE annotation (v31). Low count genes were removed from analysis using a CPM cutoff corresponding to a count of 10 reads and only confidently annotated (level 1 and 2 gene annotation) and protein-coding genes are used for differential expression analysis. Normalization factors were generated using the TMM method, counts were then transformed using voom and transformed counts were analyzed using the lmFit and eBayes functions (R limma package version 3.42.2). The significantly up- and down-regulated genes were defined by at least 2-fold changes and adjusted p-value &#x003C; 0.05. Then gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out using gene-level log2 fold changes from differential expression results against gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB 6.2) (gsea2 version 2.2.3).</p>

<title>RNA splicing analysis</title>
<p>After mapping RNA-seq data, rMATS v4.1.0 was used for RNA alternative splicing analysis by using the mapped BAM files as input. Specifically, five different kinds of alternative splicing events were identified, i.e., skipped exon (SE), alternative 5&#x2019;-splicing site (A5SS), alternative 3&#x2019;-splicing site (A3SS), mutually exclusive exon (MXE) and intron retention (RI). To keep consistent, the same GTF annotation reference file for mapping was used for rMATS. For stranded RNA-seq data, the argument &#x201C;--libType fr-firststrand&#x201D; was applied. To process reads with variable lengths, the argument &#x201C;--variable-read-length&#x201D; was also used for rMATS. To select statistically significantly differential splicing events, the following thresholds were used: FDR &#x003C;0.05 and the absolute value of IncLevelDifference &#x003E; 0.1. For visualization, the IGV Genome Browser was used to show the sashimi plots of splicing events. To investigate the genome-wide correlations of differential splicing between two genotypes (e.g., shRNA knockdown of JMJD6 and non-target shRNA in cells), we extracted splice junctions for all samples of both genotypes of interest from the STAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup> output files suffixed with &#x201C;SJ.out.tab&#x201D;, which contain high confidence collapsed splice junctions. Only those unique mapped reads crossing the junctions were considered. By extracting the union of the unique junction positions, we constructed a unified junction-read feature vector for each sample. Then, we normalized the junction-read vectors of each sample with TMM method in &#x201C;voom&#x201D; and &#x201C;limma&#x201D; and R package, assuming a negative binomial distribution. Next, we averaged the junction-read vectors for samples of the same genotype. The gene level expression was estimated based on the canonical junctions from the most abundant isoforms estimated for each gene. The fold changes of exon junctions significantly deviated from gene level changes were regarded as differentially spliced junctions for between cell-line comparisons.</p>
