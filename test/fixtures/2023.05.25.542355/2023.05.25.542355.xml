<title>Abstract</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40&#x2013;70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, LBH, in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell&#x2013;cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. LBH expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (CRYAB and VIM) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an age-dependent vascular disease, affecting 5&#x2013;35&#x0025; of men aged 40&#x2013;70 in varying degrees <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Although not fatal, 322 million men worldwide will be affected by the disease by 2025 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, it occurs in up to 75&#x0025; of diabetes cases, especially in men <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This causes significant physical and psychological problems for patients and their families <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the cavernous tissue is more prone to this disease than other blood vessels; therefore, its malfunction is considered as a biomarker in the progression of cardiovascular and vascular diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Current ED treatment involves the use of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, but patients with severe vascular disease, such as diabetic ED, are less responsive. This is mainly because severe vascular dysfunction caused by diabetes results in insufficient bioavailable NO for PDE5 inhibitors to induce penile erection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, including cell&#x2013;cell interactions, regulatory signals, and molecular regulation. Although recent studies have proposed gene expression profiles of primary cultured cavernous cells exposed to hyperglycemic conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, the relevant cell-specific relationships and genetic mechanisms in cavernous tissues have not been elucidated yet.</p>
<p>Pericytes are vital in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with ECs are essential for penile erection. Pericytes interact with various cell types (especially endothelial cells) and are involved in angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and permeability <sup>1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Diabetes causes pericyte loss or dysfunction, thereby creating an imbalance between pericytes and endothelial cells, leading to vascular diseases <sup>1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. For example, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pericyte loss, capillary basement membrane thickening, and increased permeability, leading to retinal hypoxia and inflammation. Pericytes are particularly sensitive to glucose oxidation, which further promotes pericyte apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in pericytes under hyperglycemic conditions, thereby stimulating the secretion of TGFL in peripheral nerve pericytes, leading to basement membrane thickening, neovascularization, and pericyte apoptosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our previous studies showed that restoring the content and function of cavernous pericytes significantly reduced the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and enhanced neurovascular regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in the ED remain unclear.</p>
<p>Smooth muscle cells are also a vital component of the cavernous tissues in penile erection. Diabetes mellitus leads to smooth muscle cell dysfunction, such as decreased cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in an inability to obtain or maintain satisfactory erection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Since the marker genes of pericytes and smooth muscle cells often overlap, and their expression patterns are tissue-specific, identifying suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> markers to accurately interpret transcriptional and phenotypic changes in these cell types is of utmost importance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Recent studies have identified pericyte-specific markers in different tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, enabling characterization of various cell types and their cell&#x2013;cell communication. In this study, a single-cell transcriptome analysis was performed to examine the cellular heterogeneity in erectile dysfunction caused by diabetes. The goal of this study was to identify markers specific to cavernous pericytes and understand their role in ED by exploring their interactions with other cell types.</p>

<title>Single cell transcriptional landscape of mouse cavernous tissue</title>
<p>To elucidate the cellular landscape of mouse cavernous tissue and transcriptional changes in diabetic ED at the cellular level, we conducted a single-cell transcriptome analysis, profiling 12,894 cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)</bold>. The cells were grouped into 15 clusters based on their transcriptomic patterns, and cell types were annotated based on the expression of marker genes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>, <bold>C</bold>). Clustering analysis identified fibroblasts (FB), chondrocytes (Chond), myofibroblasts (Myo-FB), lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), valve-related LEC, vascular endothelial cells (VEC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), pericytes, Schwann cells, and macrophages. The Chond and FB subsets were further annotated with additional marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1D, E</bold></xref>, <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>).</p>

<title>Identifying specific markers for pericytes in mouse cavernosum tissues</title>
<p>We distinguished SMC from pericytes by examining the expression of previously known marker genes (<italic>Cnn1</italic> for SMC, <italic>Rgs5</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> for pericytes) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. However, rather than being exclusively expressed in each cell type, known marker genes were co-expressed in each cell type. To ensure proper annotation of SMC and pericytes, we identified the gene sets enriched in each cluster through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We found that the gene sets matching pericyte and SMC functions were enriched in each cluster <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold> Gene sets related to the regulation of blood vessels and leukocytes were enriched in pericytes, whereas gene sets related to actin or muscles were enriched in SMC, suggesting that these clusters were properly annotated. In addition, we screened six genes (<italic>Lbh, Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r, Pln,</italic> and <italic>Atp1b2</italic>) that were specifically expressed in the pericyte cluster from the single-cell analysis results <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 5A)</bold>. The literature search excluded four genes, <italic>Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r,</italic> and <italic>Pln,</italic> as they are also expressed in the SMCs of other tissues or different cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. <italic>Atp1b2</italic> was also excluded because its protein expression was detected in both mouse cavernous pericytes and aortic SMC using immunofluorescence (IF) staining <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 5B)</bold>. In the single-cell data, <italic>Lbh</italic> (Limb Bud-Heart) was more specific for pericytes than <italic>Rgs5</italic>, a well-known marker for distinguishing between SMC and pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>, <bold>C)</bold>. From our IF staining, we found that LBH was optimally expressed in mouse cavernous pericyte, whereas it was rarely expressed in the smooth muscle cell (SMC) of the aorta, consistent with our single-cell data <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>, <bold>top panel)</bold>. We also verified the expression of LBH in blood vessels of other organs such as the bladder, aorta, and kidney by double staining with an endothelial cell marker (CD31) and LBH. In the blood vessels of these organs, CD31-expressing endothelial cells were surrounded by LBH-expressing pericytes but did not merge <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>, <bold>bottom panel)</bold>. Finally, we validated whether LBH is a more specific marker of pericyte in different tissues. We found that LBH expression was easily distinguishable from &#x03B1;-SMA in mouse cavernosum, dorsal artery and dorsal vein tissues, and is more specific than traditional pericyte markers (PDGFR&#x03B2;) through LBH/&#x03B1;-SMA or LBH/PDGFR&#x03B2; double staining, separately (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2E</bold></xref>). For instance, PDGFR&#x03B2; is expressed in pericytes and other surrounding tissue cells (as indicated by arrows and dotted area). This reveals that LBH is a prospective marker that can easily differentiate pericytes from smooth muscle cells or other mural cells.</p>

<title>Interactions between pericyte and other cell types in diabetes versus normal</title>
<p>Pericytes regulate various physiological functions involving other cell types such as EC and SMC. We compared the cell&#x2013;cell interactions between pericytes and other cell types based on ligand-receptor interactions in single-cell data from mouse cavernous tissues under normal and hyperglycemic conditions. In diabetes, angiogenesis-related interactions, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), were reduced between pericytes and other cell types compared to those under normal conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3A-C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In addition, interactions related to neuronal survival, adhesion, migration, and proliferation decreased in diabetic mice, as opposed to an increase in BMP signaling-related interactions <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7)</bold>. In addition to cell&#x2013;cell interactions, the overall gene sets associated with angiogenesis, adhesion, and cell migration in pericytes were downregulated under diabetic conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. We performed gene regulatory network analysis to compare the activities of transcription factors (TFs) in pericytes under diabetic and normal conditions. In normal pericytes, TFs promoting angiogenesis (<italic>Klf5</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Lmo2</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, and <italic>Elk1</italic>) were more active than in diabetic pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In contrast, TFs that inhibit angiogenesis (<italic>Ppard</italic> and <italic>Hoxd10</italic>) were more active in diabetes. Furthermore, using the proteome profiler mouse angiogenesis array, we tested 53 angiogenesis factors in cavernous tissue, among which the expression of OPN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, CD105 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, IGFBP2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, IGFBP9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and TSP-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> decreased under diabetic conditions, and only MMP-3 increased <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. MMP-3 expression in the neurovascular unit is enhanced under diabetic conditions, leading to vascular damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, angiogenesis activity decreased in mouse cavernous pericytes (MCPs) under diabetic conditions.</p>

We performed IF staining for LBH and another pericyte marker (CD140b) in mouse cavernous tissues to explore the effect of LBH on erectile dysfunction. We found that LBH and CD140b expression significantly decreased in the pericytes under diabetic conditions compared to those in age-matched controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>, <bold>C</bold>). In addition, we assessed the expression of LBH <italic>in vitro</italic> under diabetic conditions and found that its expression was significantly decreased compared to that under normal conditions in mouse cavernous pericytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>, <bold>D</bold>). All IF staining results were confirmed by western blotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4E</bold></xref>, <bold>F</bold>). In addition, we overexpressed LBH in diabetic mice by intracavernosal injection of lentiviruses containing an ORF mouse clone of LBH and assessed erectile function two weeks later. During electrical stimulation, the ratios of maximal and total intracavernous pressure (ICP) to mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP) were significantly reduced in PBS- and lentivirus ORF control particle-treated diabetic mice compared to age-matched controls. However, LBH overexpression in diabetic mice significantly improved this erection parameter, reaching 84&#x0025; of the control values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4G</bold></xref>, <bold>H</bold>). Moreover, IF staining for CD31 (an endothelial cell marker), NG2 (a pericyte marker), neurofilament-2000 (NF), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) revealed that LBH overexpression significantly improved the endothelial cell, pericyte, and neuronal cell contents in diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4I-N</bold></xref>). These effects were achieved by inducing MCPs survival (decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation, migration, and tube formation) and major pelvic ganglion (MPG) neurite sprouting under diabetic conditions (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 8</bold>). Thus, LBH is vital in promoting neurovascular regeneration under diabetic conditions.</p>

<title>LBH-interacting protein identification in mouse cavernous pericytes</title>
<p>We conducted LC-MS/MS analysis following the immunoprecipitation of LBH from mouse cavernous pericytes to further elucidate the LBH-mediated systematic network in mouse cavernous pericytes.

<p>Based on the STRING and BioGrid databases, we reconstructed the PPI network of CRYAB, VIM, and LBH, and the primary and secondary interacting proteins of LBH <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions of LBH CRYAB, and VIM, we performed gene ontology analysis using proteins from the PPI network. We found that these proteins are mainly involved in neurogenesis, neuronal development, and the nervous system <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6F</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In addition, the proteins involved in &#x2018;angiogenesis&#x2019; and &#x2018;response to estradiol&#x2019; that are associated with pericyte activity were also included in this PPI network. Since the expression of LBH was decreased in the pericytes under diabetic conditions, we identified the expression level of angiogenesis and nerve system-related genes in diabetic pericytes using single-cell data. GSEA showed that gene sets related to angiogenesis and the nervous system were enriched in normal pericytes compared to diabetic pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6G</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DM is a major cause of ED, and poor long-term glycemic control can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Many studies have outlined angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, such as VEGF, Comp-Ang1, dickkopf2, leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT3) that been tested as therapeutic options for ED <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. However, poor efficacy, side effects such as inflammation, and complex drug-protein engineering have limited their success in clinical trials. A more detailed understanding of the intercellular signaling mechanisms and microenvironment in the penis under physiological and pathological conditions are necessary to provide more effective therapeutic targets. We therefore employed single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the complex transcriptional changes in various cell types in ED using a diabetes-induced ED mouse model, as diabetic ED accounts for 75&#x0025; of ED patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Our findings from <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were confirmed using human data and samples, enabling us to understand how the results from mouse models could be translated to humans and developed as novel treatment targets.</p>
<p>To repair vascular and neural tissues in the penile corpus cavernosum damaged by DM, we focused on pericytes, which are multipotent perivascular cells that contribute to the generation and repair of various tissues in response to injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Although recent studies have shown that pericytes are involved in physiological mechanisms of erection, little is known about their detailed mechanisms. Many known pericyte markers are co-expressed in other cell types; thus, identifying the specific marker genes for pericytes <italic>in vivo</italic> is the first step characterizing pericyte cell type. From the pericyte cluster in the single-cell RNA sequencing results, we found that <italic>Lbh, Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r, Plm,</italic> and <italic>Atp1b2</italic> are specific pericyte markers (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6</bold>). LBH was identified as a pericyte-positive and SMC-negative marker that was also specifically expressed in human cavernous pericytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>) and was validated through IF staining in many vascular tissues and cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>LBH, a highly conserved transcription cofactor, is known to participate in early limb and heart development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, LBH can directly target the Wnt signaling pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and regulate neural crest cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In addition, Jiang et al. showed that LBH overexpression promotes angiogenesis via VEGF-mediated ERK signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, LBH inhibits cell migration and angiogenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. These inconsistent results may be related to different histopathological environments. Thus, LBH has dual effects on the development of blood vessels and the nervous system, similar to other angioneurins such as VEGF and BDNF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Here, we explored the role of LBH in the penile tissues of diabetic mice. Interestingly, LBH expression was significantly lower in cavernous pericytes in a diabetic mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that the restoration of LBH expression in the penis of diabetic mice will improve erectile function. Our results showed that LBH can restores diabetes-induced ED by restoring neurovascular regeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRYAB promotes angiogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and interacts with LBH in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, where it enhances cell survival by inhibiting the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our LC-MS/MS analysis of LBH following immunoprecipitation of MCPs identified VIM as a novel interaction partner and CRYAB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). In addition, we assessed the expression of CRYAB and VIM under diabetic conditions. Unexpectedly, the expression of VIM was increased, whereas that of CRYAB was downregulated in the penis of diabetic mice and MCPs under diabetic conditions. VIM is a type III intermediate filament protein expressed in mesenchymal cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. It is involved in cell adhesion, migration, cellular integrity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the malignant transformation and metastatic spread of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. It is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several other proteins with many functions under various pathophysiological conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. For example, VIM interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, promotes axonal extension, and serves as a double-edged sword in the nervous system by regulating axonal regeneration, myelination, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>Vim</italic> knockout mice were less susceptible to bacterial infections and had a reduced inflammatory response than wild-type mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Recently, <italic>Vim</italic> deficiency was shown to prevent obesity and insulin resistance in type 2 DM by reducing CD36 expression on plasma membranes and intracellular trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 in adipocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Therefore, the combination of LBH with CRYAB and VIM could improve neurovascular regeneration in diabetic ED by activating the angiogenic effects of CRYAB and potentially reducing the inflammatory effects of VIM. Further studies are required to better understand the exact regulatory mechanisms underlying the effects of LBH and its binding partners.</p>

Animals were monitored daily for health and behavior as previous studies described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were maintained at room temperature (RT) (23 &#x00B1; 2&#x00B0;C), 40-60&#x0025; relative humidity, 12 hours light/dark cycle, and specific pathogen-free conditions. Sixty adult male C57BL/6 mice were used for single cell sequencing analysis, mouse cavernous pericyte culture (<italic>in vitro</italic> study), and erectile function evaluation (<italic>in vivo</italic> study). All animals were anesthetized with intramuscular injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg, Yuhan Corp., Seoul, Korea) and xylazine (5 mg/kg, Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). Animals were euthanized by 100&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> gas exchange in a closed container at a CO<sub>2</sub> exchange rate of 10-30&#x0025; container volume/min. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced as described previously. Shortly, low doses of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected for 5 consecutive days. Eight weeks later, only mice with a tail vein blood glucose level higher than 300 mg/dL and significantly decreased body weights were considered to have DM. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were determined using an Accu-Check blood glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) before starting all <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.

<p>FASTQ files from sequencing were aligned to the mouse reference sequence (mm10) using CellRanger count pipeline (10x Genomics, Version 3.0.2). Filtered feature-barcode matrices outputs by CellRanger were used to create Seurat objects for single cell RNA sequencing data analysis (Seurat v3.1.5). Cells with the number of genes less than 200 were filtered out from Seurat objects. Quality controlled data were normalized using NormalizeData function with default parameters. Highly variable features were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function with default parameters. Data were scaled by setting the number of UMI as variables to regress out using ScaleData function. The scaled data were merged into one Seurat object, and then normalized, and highly variable genes were identified and scaled. Linear dimensional reduction performed using RunPCA function with 30 principal components. The RunHarmony function was used to correct the batch effect between the merged data.

<title>Single cell gene regulatory network analysis</title>
<p>Transcription factor (TF) activity of normal or diabetic pericyte were identified using SCENIC R package (v1.1.2-01). To avoid narrow comparison of TF activity in pericytes between normal and diabetic conditions that could lead to faulty reasoning, we included SMCs in the comparison as well. Raw count matrices of SMC and Pericyte extracted from the Seurat object were used as input for SCENIC. 10 kb around the transcription start site (TSS) and 500 bp upstream of the TSS were selected for motif ranking. Genes in input matrix were filtered using geneFiltering function with default parameters. To split targets into positive and negative correlated targets, the correlation was calculated using runCorrelation function. Potential transcription factor targets were inferred using runGenie3 function. Building and scoring the gene regulatory network were performed using runSCENIC functions. Clustering and dimensionality reduction on the regulon activity were performed using tsneAUC function. Only angiogenesis-related TFs with differences in activity between normal and diabetic pericytes were visualized in the heatmap.</p>

<title>Measurement of Erectile Function</title>
<p>Erectile function was measured after mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100Lmg/kg) and xylazine (5Lmg/kg) as described previously. Briefly, the cavernous nerve was stimulated for 1 minute using bipolar platinum wire electrodes at 1 or 5 V at 12 Hz and a pulse width of 1 ms condition. Each stimulation was repeated at least 2 times every 10 minutes. Record the maximal intracavernous pressure (ICP) and total ICP during stimulation. The area under the curve (AUC) from the initiation of cavernous nerve stimulation to 20 seconds after stimulation termination was measured as total ICP. Before ICP measurements, the systemic blood pressure was measured continuously using a noninvasive tail-cuff system (Visitech Systems, Apex, NC, USA). The ratio of maximal ICP and total ICP to mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP) was calculated to normalize variations in systemic blood pressure.</p>
