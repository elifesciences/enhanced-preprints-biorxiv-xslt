<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Evolution can tinker with multi-protein machines and replace them with simpler single-protein systems performing equivalent functions in equally efficient manner. It is unclear how, on a molecular level, such simplification can arise. With ancestral reconstruction and biochemical analysis we have traced the evolution of bacterial small heat shock proteins (sHsp), which help to refold proteins from aggregates using either two proteins with different functions (IbpA and IbpB) or a secondarily single sHsp that performs both functions in an equally efficient way. Secondarily single sHsp evolved from IbpA, an ancestor specialized in strong substrate binding. Evolution of an intermolecular binding site drove the alteration of substrate binding properties, as well as formation of higher-order oligomers. Upon two mutations in the &#x03B1;-crystallin domain, secondarily single sHsp interacts with aggregated substrates less tightly. Paradoxically, less efficient binding positively influences the ability of sHsp to stimulate substrate refolding, since the dissociation of sHps from aggregates is required to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding. After the loss of a partner, IbpA took over its role in facilitating the sHsp dissociation from an aggregate by weakening the interaction with the substrate, which became beneficial for the refolding process. We show that the same two amino acids introduced in modern-day system define whether the IbpA acts as a single sHsp or obligatorily cooperates with an IbpB partner. Our discoveries illuminate how one sequence has evolved to encode functions previously performed by two distinct proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene birth and loss is a hallmark of protein family evolution, however molecular determinants and genetic mechanisms enabling that process are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fernandez &#x0026; Gabaldon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Worth <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Gene loss and differential retention of paralogues reshapes the divergence of organisms both in <italic>Animalia, Archaea</italic> and <italic>Bacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fernandez &#x0026; Gabaldon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iranzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puigbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Examples of gene loss often involve adaptive changes in response to changing environmental niches, like loss of genes encoding olfactory receptors in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Demuth &#x0026; Hahn, 2009</xref>) or differential retention of paralogous genes encoding venom toxins in different rattlesnake lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dowell <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In prokaryote genomes, gene loss is one of the main evolutionary processes accelerating sequence divergence leading to functional innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Puigbo <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). In complex protein systems execution of a cellular function can be shared between several proteins. In bacteria the cost of maintaining additional gene copy is very high and maintaining low gene count is important for keeping the replication energy costs low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kempes <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lever <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lynch &#x0026; Marinov, 2015</xref>). Still, it remains unclear how a multi-protein system can undergo simplification. Here we asked what are the molecular events that enabled the gene loss, and how one of the biochemical functions has been taken over by the other protein. We investigated these questions using small heat shock protein (sHsp) system, which underwent simplification within <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (which include common bacteria species like <italic>Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Erwinia amylovora)</italic> as a model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>sHsps are a family of ATP &#x2013; independent molecular chaperones present in all living organisms with various copy numbers (ten representatives in human) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Haslbeck &#x0026; Vierling, 2015</xref>). They bind misfolded proteins and sequester them into refolding &#x2013; prone assemblies, preventing uncontrolled aggregation and helping to maintain proteostasis at stress conditions. sHsp are composed of a highly conserved &#x03B1;&#x2013;crystallin domain (ACD), in a form of so-called &#x03B2;&#x2013;sandwich, flanked by less conserved, unstructured N &#x2013; and C &#x2013; terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Haslbeck &#x0026; Vierling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haslbeck <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Reinle <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Their smallest functional unit is usually a dimer, formed by the interaction between ACDs of two neighboring sHsps. Stable sHsp dimers in turn tend to form variable and dynamic higher &#x2013; order oligomers, stabilized by N &#x2013; and C &#x2013; terminal region interactions. Particularly the interaction between IXI motif, highly conserved in sHsps C-termini, and the cleft formed by &#x03B2;4 and &#x03B2;8 strands of ACD is critical for oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Haslbeck &#x0026; Vierling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kennaway <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mani <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strozecka <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Oligomers of bacterial sHsps reversibly dissociate into smaller forms when the temperature increases. It is considered their activation mechanism, probably uncovering substrate interaction sites. The mechanism of sHsps&#x2019; interaction with misfolded substrates is not yet fully understood, but both N - termini and &#x03B2;4 &#x2013; &#x03B2;8 cleft region have been found to play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basha <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jaya <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Reinle <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In most <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> a two-protein sHsps system exists, consisting of IbpA and IbpB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mogk <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). IbpA and IbpB have originated via duplication, form a heterodimer partnership and are functionally divergent from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pirog <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). IbpA is specialized in tight substrate binding (sequestrase activity), while IbpB is required for dissociation of both sHps from the aggregates, a step necessary to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100 dependent substrate disaggregation and refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ratajczak <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In a subset of <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (<italic>Erwiniaceae</italic>), as a result of <italic>ibpB</italic> gene loss, the secondarily single-protein sHsp (IbpA) system has emerged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The term &#x201C;secondarily single&#x201D; is used in order to distinguish it from single-protein IbpA from clades in which the duplication did not occur (for example <italic>Vibrionaceae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). How did IbpA evolve to become independent of its partner? In this study, using ancestral reconstruction, we identify mutations, which allowed the secondarily single IbpA to be fully functional without its partner in substrate sequestration and handover to Hsp70-Hsp100-mediated disaggregation and refolding.</p>

<title>New activity of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> IbpA has evolved in parallel to <italic>ibpB</italic> gene loss</title>
<p>To better understand the evolution of sHsps after gene loss, we reconstructed the IbpA ancestors from before and after the loss of its IbpB partner. This technique uses multiple sequence alignments of modern-day proteins from different species to infer amino acid sequences of its common ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashkenazy <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pupko <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) and is widely used to investigate various evolutionary questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gaucher <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Longo <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Thomson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Thornton <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). We created a multiple sequence alignment of 77 IbpA sequences from <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> (supplementary file 1), from which we inferred the phylogeny of IbpA using maximum likelihood method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, supplementary file 2 &#x2013; phylogenetic tree in newick format). From that we inferred ancestral sequences, which have the highest probability of producing the modern-day sequences using the empirical Bayes method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ashkenazy <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cohen &#x0026; Pupko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cohen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pupko <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Simmons &#x0026; Ochoterena, 2000</xref>). Next, we resurrected (i.e., expressed and purified) the last ancestor of IbpA present before (AncA<sub>0</sub>) and after (AncA<sub>1</sub>) the differential gene loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, supplementary file 3).</p>

<p>Similarly, to modern-day IbpA proteins both AncA<sub>0</sub> and AncA<sub>1</sub> were fully folded, and reversibly deoligomerized into smaller species under elevated temperature (Fig. 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 1). Moreover, both ancestral proteins were able to sequester aggregating firefly luciferase in sHsp-substrate assemblies. AncA<sub>0</sub> exhibited sequestrase activity on the level comparable to IbpA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic></sub>). AncA<sub>1</sub> was moderately efficient in this process and IbpA from <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic> (IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>amyl</italic></sub>) was the least efficient sequestrase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The differences in sequestrase activity were especially pronounced at lower sHsp concentrations. Next, we tested their ability to bind protein aggregates in real time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Ancestral proteins&#x2019; interaction with the aggregated substrates was stronger than in the case of extant <italic>E. amylovora</italic> IbpA, but weaker than in the case of extant <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="541272v3_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Finally, we asked how the modification of the substrate aggregation process by reconstructed proteins influences subsequent substrate refolding by the Hsp100 and Hsp70 chaperones. AncA<sub>1</sub> stimulated luciferase refolding, however its effectiveness was around half of both analyzed extant sHsp systems (single IbpA from <italic>E. amylovora</italic> or IbpA &#x002B; IbpB system from <italic>E. coli</italic>), similar to extant IbpA form <italic>E. coli</italic> without it&#x2019;s IbpB partner. AncA<sub>0</sub>, in contrast, inhibited luciferase refolding in comparison to control (no sHsps at substrate aggregation step) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the robustness of our observations, we repeated the analysis for the alternative ancestors, which have the second highest probability to produce the modern-day sequences (AltAll) (Fig. 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 2, supplementary file 3 &#x2013; posterior probabilities) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Eick <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Both AltAll variants behaved similarly to most likely (ML) variants in reversible deoligomerization, sequestrase activity and stimulation of substrate refolding assays (Fig. 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 3 A-D). However, the last property (the influence on refolding) required higher Hsp70 system concentration to observe AltAll variants activity (Fig. 3 &#x2013; figure supplement 3 C,D). Together, these data show that reconstructed ML and AltAll ancestors are functional. What is of particular interest, these data clearly point out that the ability of reconstructed sHsps to stimulate Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding arose between A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> nodes.</p>
<p>We performed a molecular evolution analysis to test for positive selection across IbpA phylogeny using both branch models and branch-site models in codeml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jeffares <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yang, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yang &#x0026; Nielsen, 2002</xref>). The analysis shows a significantly increased ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, after the gene loss, at the branch leading to A<sub>1</sub> with both tests. This result indicates that the new IbpA functionality likely arose due to an episode of positive selection rather than genetic drift (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, Supplementary file 4 A,B). The result of the branch-site test indicates possible positive selection acting on all sites substituted at the branch leading to A<sub>1</sub> with pp&#x003E;0.5, therefore we aimed to identify minimum number of mutations that are responsible for a change in functional properties of IbpA.</p>

<title>Identification of residues defining ancestral sHsps activities</title>
<p>In order to identify amino acids responsible for the observed new functionality of AncA<sub>1</sub>, we compared the sequences of two ancestral proteins, selecting seven out of ten substitutions as probable candidates. Three substitutions were removed from analysis based on the low conservation of these positions in extant proteins (Fig. 4 &#x2013; figure supplement 1). The remaining seven were introduced into AncA<sub>0</sub> . Resulting AncA<sub>0</sub> &#x002B;7 protein stimulated Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent luciferase refolding at the level comparable to AncA<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To further specify key mutations, we prepared seven additional variants. In each variant a different position in AncA<sub>0</sub> &#x002B;7 was reversed to a more ancestral state. The substantial decrease in luciferase refolding stimulation was observed for positions 66 and 109 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Next, each of these substitutions on its own (Q66H or G109D) was separately introduced into AncA<sub>0</sub> . This was not sufficient to increase AncA<sub>0</sub> ability to stimulate luciferase refolding. However, when both substitutions were introduced simultaneously, the resulting sHsp exhibited activity similar to AncA<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). What is more, when in AncA<sub>1</sub> these two positions were reversed to AncA<sub>0</sub> -like state, the resulting sHsp lost the ability to stimulate luciferase refolding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). All analyzed proteins, namely AncA<sub>0</sub> &#x002B;7, AncA<sub>0</sub> Q66H G109D and AncA<sub>1</sub> H66Q D109G, possess biochemical properties characteristic for sHsps, exhibiting reversible thermal deoligomerization and sequestrase activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> &#x2013; figure supplement 2 A,B). All these results show that substitutions Q66H and G109D are both sufficient and necessary for the increase in activity observed for ancestral sHsps between A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> nodes.</p>

<title>Identified substitutions influence &#x03B1;-crystallin domain properties</title>
<p>Substitutions Q66H and G109D, responsible for gaining single sHsp activity, are located in the &#x03B1;-crystallin domain (ACD) within &#x03B2;4 and &#x03B2;8 strands, which form a cleft responsible for the interaction with unstructured C-terminal peptide of the neighboring sHsp dimer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In order to identify possible structural underpinnings of the single sHsp activity we have predicted structures of AncA<sub>0</sub> and AncA<sub>0</sub> Q66H G109D &#x03B1;-crystallin domain (ACD) dimers in complex with C-terminal peptide using AlphaFold2 and <italic>in silico</italic> mutagenesis and subjected them to 0.5 &#x03BC;s equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Analysis of the C-terminal peptide interface contact probabilities in MD trajectories showed that both substituted residues contact the C-terminal peptide, although overall contact pattern remain similar upon their introduction (Fig. 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 1) and no major differences in the overall ACD domains structure were observed (Fig. 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 2) . To explore the possibility that identified substitutions affect strength of this interaction, we analyzed binding of purified ACDs of AncA<sub>0</sub> and AncA<sub>0</sub> Q66H G109D to C&#x2013; terminal peptide using biolayer interferometry. Titrations of immobilized C-terminal peptide by different ACDs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref>, 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 3) allowed us to determine the dissociation constants. These two substitutions increased the K<sub>0.5</sub> of ACD binding to the C -terminal peptide from 4.3 &#x03BC;M to 7.1 &#x03BC;M at the same time increasing the Hill coefficient of the interaction from 2.3 to 3.7, indicating a modest decrease in affinity, accompanied by an increase in binding cooperativity.</p>

<p>As this interaction is known to play a crucial role in formation of sHsp oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fu <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mani <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Strozecka <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), we used dynamic light scattering to investigate how Q66H and G109D substitutions influence the size of oligomers formed by AncA<sub>0</sub> at different temperatures. In agreement with decreased affinity between ACD and the C&#x2013;terminal peptide, we have shown that these substitutions slightly decrease the oligomer size and facilitate AncA<sub>0</sub> deoligomerization (Figure 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 4 A,B).</p>
<p>&#x03B2;4-&#x03B2;8 cleft in certain sHsps, in addition to its interaction with C &#x2013; terminal peptide, was also shown to participate in interactions with substrates and partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jaya <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Reinle <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether ACD of AncA<sub>0</sub> binds protein aggregates and whether this interaction is influenced by Q66H G109D substitutions. We observed that AncA<sub>0</sub> ACD efficiently binds to either aggregated <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate or aggregated luciferase, and this binding was weakened by analyzed substitutions (Figs. 5C, 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 5). This suggests that ACD of bacterial sHsps interacts with the substrate, most likely through the &#x03B2;4-&#x03B2;8 cleft.</p>
<p>These results allow us to conclude that substitutions Q66H and G109D in AncA<sub>0</sub> substantially increased the sHsp ability to stimulate Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding by weakening the interaction of &#x03B2;4-&#x03B2;8 cleft with both the C-terminal peptide and the aggregated substrates. Despite its ability to bind aggregated substrates in biolayer interferometry assay, analyzed ACDs do not exhibit sequestrase activity and were unable to positively influence substrate refolding by the Hsp70-Hsp100 system (Fig. 5 &#x2013; figure supplement 5 B,C).</p>

<p>Above results suggest that tight sHsp binding to aggregates negatively affects subsequent Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding process. It is initiated by binding of the Hsp70 system (DnaK and cochaperones DnaJ and GrpE) to aggregates that requires sHsps to be outcompeted from aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zwirowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). To gain insight into the competition between sHsps and Hsp70 we modified the biolayer interferometry experiments and introduced the sensor with sHsps bound to luciferase aggregates into a buffer containing Hsp70 system (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Although biolayer interferometry cannot distinguish between proteins bound to the sensor, we took advantage of the differences in the thickness of the protein layers specific for sHsp or Hsp70 binding and also in the binding kinetics. The analysis of the Hsp70 binding to the aggregates covered with sHsps clearly shows that the presence of IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>amyl</italic></sub> or IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic></sub> Q66H G109D on aggregates only weakly inhibits Hsp70 binding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E,H</xref>). In contrast, the inhibition is much more pronounced when IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>amyl</italic></sub> H67Q D110G or IbpA<sub><italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic></sub> are present on aggregates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F,G</xref>).</p>
<p>All above experiments indicate that two specific amino acids in positions 66 and 109 in ACD of IbpA proteins define the mode of IbpA activity. Glutamine 66 and glycine 109 are characteristic for IbpA proteins which bind tightly to substrates and thus are not easily outcompeted from the aggregates by Hsp70s. Such IbpAs require IbpB partner cooperation to function properly. Substitutions at these positions to histidine (position 66) and aspartic acid (position 109) allowed for the emergence of a single sHsp which binds to aggregating substrate less tightly and can be outcompeted from the aggregates by Hsp70s in the absence of IbpB.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we traced, at the molecular level, how the two-protein sHsp system, a part of the cellular protein refolding machinery, underwent simplification in a way that its biochemical functions are performed by a single protein. In most <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> two sHsps (IbpA and IbpB) drive sequestration of misfolded proteins into the reactivation-prone assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Together, IbpA and IbpB form a functional heterodimer, in which IbpA specializes in substrate binding, preventing the substrates from creating large aggregates (sequestrase activity), while IbpB promotes sHsps dissociation from the aggregates required for subsequent Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pirog <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We showed that, in parallel to the <italic>ibpB</italic> gene loss in <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic>, new functions of IbpA have emerged, i.e. a lower substrate sequestrase activity, which correlates with the efficient substrate refolding. We have identified two amino acid substitutions (Q66H and G109D) responsible for this new IbpA functionality. Selection analysis shows that these two substitutions were likely driven by positive selective pressure. This indicates that this change possibly had an adaptive character in the ancestral background. It is important to note, however, that models used for the analysis do not account for variation of synonymous substitution rate and multinucleotide substitution events, which in some cases might lead to false positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lucaci <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Because of that, the alternative hypothesis that substitutions Q66H and G109D occurred in the common ancestor of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> due to genetic drift, enabling the subsequent loss of <italic>ibpB</italic> gene, cannot be fully discounted. Functional differences observed between modern-day sHsps from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. amylovora</italic> are at least partially defined by presence of specific amino acids in these two positions and can be diminished by their swapping between extant proteins. Their occurrence in the last common ancestor of <italic>Erwiniaceae</italic> IbpA resulted in a decreased affinity of ACD&#x2019;s &#x03B2;4-&#x03B2;8 cleft to aggregated substrates as well as to the C&#x2013;termini of the other sHsps. These interactions might be of particular importance for stabilization of sHsps on a surface of sequestered aggregated substrates leading to the formation of so-called protective shell preventing further uncontrolled aggregation. Apparent role of C-termini and ACD interaction is in agreement with earlier studies, showing that addition of free C-terminal peptide causes <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA and IbpB dissociation from the outer shell of sHsp - substrate complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zwirowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). It was also shown that, in case of Hsp 16.6 from cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, substitutions that slightly weakened interaction between ACD and C-termini lead to increased stimulation of luciferase refolding. However, abolishing this interaction resulted in a non-functional protein, most likely due to the loss of the sequestrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giese &#x0026; Vierling, 2002</xref>). Destabilization of the protective shell of secondarily single IbpA by weakening these interactions had an effect functionally analogous to a role of IbpB in the two-protein system, facilitating IbpA dissociation from the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obuchowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Two identified substitutions also weaken the ACD interaction with aggregated substrates which is an additional factor shifting the sHsps balance towards dissociation, a step necessary to initiate Hsp70-Hsp100 dependent disaggregation and refolding.</p>
<p>Our results show how ACD substitutions can fine-tune sHsp system by exerting pleiotropic effects on ACD - C-terminal peptide and ACD - substrate interactions. These relatively small changes strongly influence the effectiveness of sHsp functioning in complex process of aggregated protein rescue by molecular chaperones. It might be particularly important in the case of a conserved interaction, like the one between C - terminal peptide and ACD, when excessive changes of affinity may be detrimental to the overall protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Giese &#x0026; Vierling, 2002</xref>). Our approach enabled us to find functional residues in sHsp system, which would not have been possible by using conventional mutagenesis and highlights the importance of using vertical approach in biochemical studies. This study closely follows the evolutionary process, in which mutations in one of the two cooperating proteins tinker it to a point it becomes independent of its partner, enabling the simplification of a more complex system by partner loss while maintaining its overall function.</p>
<p>Following, with molecular precision, the genetic events associated with the gene loss allowed us to answer several questions about protein family evolution. The first question concerns how the lost function is incorporated into a remaining partner protein. The results of our experiments indicate that even though the primary function of a partner protein is maintained, it is altered so that it does not interfere with the newly incorporated one. In our case substrate binding properties, as well as formation of higher-order oligomers were altered in a way to keep the sequestrase function maintained but allow for more efficient stimulation of Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent substrate refolding. The second question concerns the context-dependence of mutations in protein evolution. We successfully transplanted the mutations that appeared in <italic>E. amylovora</italic> into <italic>E. coli</italic> IbpA ortholog, artificially creating an efficient single protein system from a protein that normally needs a partner for efficient substrate refolding. In contrast to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Natarajan <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) the context of <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> IbpA protein did not influence the ability of IbpA<sub>E.coli</sub> Q66H G109D to work without IbpB partner. This brings the question about the accessibility of adaptive solutions. In case of <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> IbpA there was no need for adaptive changes because the gene loss did not occur in this clade, suggesting that the loss of a protein can push another one towards an adaptation, which leads to finding efficient molecular innovations.</p>

Denatured luciferase was then incubated at 25 &#x00B0;C with Hsp70 system (1 &#x03BC;M DnaK, 0.4 &#x03BC;M DnaJ and 0.3 &#x03BC;M GrpE), 2 &#x03BC;M ClpB, and ATP regeneration system (5 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase and 18 mM creatine phosphate). For experiment presented in Fig.3 &#x2013; figure supplement 3D, higher concentration of the Hsp70 system was used (2 &#x03BC;M DnaK, 0.8 &#x03BC;M DnaJ and 0.6 &#x03BC;M GrpE). At different timepoints luciferase activity was measured with GLOMAX&#x2122; 20/20 luminometer, using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega. Results are presented as averages of at least three independent repeats &#x00B1; standard deviation.</p>

<title>DLS measurements</title>
<p>Dynamic Light Scattering measurements were performed using Malvern Instruments ZetaSizer Nano S instrument, at 40 &#x03BC;l sample volume, scattering angle 173&#x00B0; and wavelength of 633 nm. For every measurement, minimum ten subsequent series of ten 10-s runs were averaged and particle size distribution was calculated by fitting to 70 size bins between 0.4 and 10,000 nm, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zwirowski <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>For reversible deoligomerization assay, size of oligomers formed by 10 &#x03BC;M sHsps in buffer F (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM DTT) were measured by DLS. First measurement was performed at 25&#x00B0;C and then the sample was heated to 44&#x00B0;C, cooled to 25&#x00B0;C, heated to 44&#x00B0;C and cooled to 25&#x00B0;C, with measurements performed after each change in temperature. Results are presented as size distribution by volume.</p>
<p>For measuring influence of substitutions on oligomer formation, size of oligomers formed by either 10 &#x03BC;M AncA<sub>0</sub> or 10 &#x03BC;M AncA<sub>0</sub> Q66H G109D in buffer F (as above) was measured by DLS at 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43 and 45&#x00B0;C. Results were presented as size distribution by intensity (for temperatures 25&#x00B0;C, 35&#x00B0;C and 45&#x00B0;C) or as an average hydrodynamic diameter corresponding to maximum of a dominant peak of size distribution by volume plotted against temperature &#x00B1; standard deviation.</p>
<p>For assembly formation (sequestrase) assay, 1.5 &#x03BC;M firefly luciferase in buffer F was denatured alone or in the presence of different sHsp concentrations by incubation at 44&#x00B0;C for 10 min. Size of obtained luciferase aggregates was then measured by DLS at 25&#x00B0;C. Results are presented as an average hydrodynamic diameter of measured particles weighted by intensity (Z-average) &#x00B1; standard deviation.</p>

<title>Biolayer interferometry (BLI) measurements</title>
<p>sHsps interactions with aggregated luciferase or aggregated <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate were measured using Octet &#x00AE; K2 system. Anchoring layer of his-tagged luciferase was attached to Octet&#x00AE; NTA Biosensors by 5 min incubation in 0.6 mg/ml his-tagged luciferase in denaturing conditions in buffer UF (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 4.5 M urea, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM DTT) at 25 &#x00B0;C with 350 rpm shaking. Sensors were then incubated for 5 min as above in buffer H (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM &#x03B2;-mercaptoethanol) to remove urea and unbound luciferase. The protein aggregate was then formed on the sensor by incubation for 10 min in 0,5 mg/ml his-tagged luciferase or 0.2 mg/ml <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate in buffer H at 44&#x00B0;C (in case of the luciferase) or 55 &#x00B0;C (in case of the lysate). Sensors were then again incubated in buffer H for 5 min at 25 &#x00B0;C with 350 rpm shaking to remove excess protein. Sensors with attached aggregate were placed in the Octet&#x00AE; system in H buffer for 60 s baseline measurement and then placed for 1h in 5 &#x03BC;M sHsp solution in H buffer to measure sHsps association. Sensors were then moved for 1h to buffer H to measure protein dissociation. Measurements were performed with 1000 rpm shaking at 44&#x00B0;C (in case of full - length sHsps) or at 25&#x00B0;C (in case of ACDs). Full-length proteins were preincubated at 44&#x00B0;C for 10 min before measurement.</p>
<p>sHsps displacement by Hsp70 system was measured using ForteBio&#x00AE; BLItz. Sensors with attached aggregates were prepared as described above, with buffer F (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM DTT) instead of buffer H. Baseline biolayer was measured for 60 s. Sensors were then placed in 5 &#x03BC;M sHsp solution in buffer F, previously preincubated for 10 min at 44&#x00B0;C. sHsps association was measured for 10 min. Sensors were then moved to either buffer F or Hsp70 system in buffer F (0.7 &#x03BC;M DnaK, 0.28 &#x03BC;M DnaJ, 0.21 &#x03BC;M GrpE, 5 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 18 mM creatine phosphate). Hsp70 system binding and sHsps dissociation were measured for 1h. Measurements were performed at room temperature with 2000 rpm shaking.</p>
<p>ACD interactions with C &#x2013;terminal peptide were measured using Octet&#x00AE; K2 system. Octet&#x00AE; NTA Biosensors were placed in buffer C (50mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5&#x0025; glycerol, 5 mM &#x03B2;-mercaptoethanol) and baseline signal was measured for 60 s. Sensors were then placed in 2.5 &#x03BC;M His<sub>6</sub> -SUMO-C-peptide solution in buffer C and incubated for 15 min. Surplus His<sub>6</sub> -SUMO-C-peptide was then removed by incubation in G buffer for 15 min. Sensors were then moved to ACD solution and association was measured for 48 min. After that, ACD dissociation was measured in buffer G for 10 min. Measurements were performed with 1000 rpm shaking at 25&#x00B0;C. Measurements were performed for different ACD concentrations in triplicates. Biolayer thickness at the end of association stage was corrected for the nonspecific binding using control substituting His<sub>6</sub> -SUMO for His<sub>6</sub> -SUMO-C-peptide and converted to fraction bound by min-max scaling between 0 and 1 using minimal and maximal triplicate averages of biolayer thickness. To determine dissociation constant fraction bound as a function of ACD concentration was fitted to the Hill equation using SciPy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Virtanen <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) of dogbox algorithm:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">

</disp-formula>
Where [X] is the total ACD concentration, K<sub>0.5</sub> &#x2013; ACD concentration required to reach half-maximum binding at equilibrium, n &#x2013; Hill coefficient, f<sub>b</sub> - fraction bound. Standard deviations of fitted K<sub>0.5</sub> and n values were derived from the diagonal of optimized parameters covariance matrix.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics (MD)</title>
<p>All MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 2019.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Van Der Spoel <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and CHARMM36-jul2021 as a force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Simulations were performed in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, where temperature was kept at 310 K using v-rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bussi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) with a time constant of 0.1 ps and the pressure was held at 1 bar using Parinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parrinello &#x0026; Rahman, 1981</xref>). Lennard-Jones potential with a cut-off of 1.0 nm was used to describe Van der Waals interactions. Computation of long-range electrostatic interactions was performed using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Essmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) with a Fourier grid spacing of 0.12 nm and a real space cutoff of 1.0 nm. Bonds between hydrogen and protein heavy atoms were constrained by P-LINCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hess <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) and water molecules geometry was constrained by SETTLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Miyamoto &#x0026; Kollman, 1992</xref>). Integration of equations of motion was performed by leap-frog algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Van Gunsteren &#x0026; Berendsen, 1988</xref>) with a time step of 2 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all dimensions.</p>
<p>The initial conformation of AncA<sub>0</sub> ACD - C-terminal peptide complex was predicted by ColabFold implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mirdita <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) of AlphaFold-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Richard <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) Substitutions Q66H and G109D were introduced to the complex using PyMol Mutagenesis Wizard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>). Complexes were then placed in rhombic dodecahedral boxes measuring 10.4 nm in all dimensions and solvated by CHARMM-modified TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jorgensen <italic>et al</italic>, 1983</xref>). Concentrations of sodium and chloride ions were adjusted to 0.15 M and net zero charge of the system. Each system was subjected to 3-step energy minimization protocol, where during the first step protein conformation was constrained, during the second step constraint was reduced to protein backbone only and during the third step positions of all protein heavy atoms were restrained with a force constant of 1000 kJ&#x002A;mol<sup>-1</sup>&#x002A;nm<sup>-1</sup>. Minimized systems were equilibrated for 10 ns while positions of protein backbone atoms were kept constrained, equilibration was then continued without constraints for further 500 ns. The first 100 ns of equilibration was discarded, and the rest was used for ACD &#x2013; C-terminal peptide contact determination using GetContacts tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://getcontacts.github.io/">https://getcontacts.github.io/</ext-link>). Contact between interfacial residues was defined as any of the following types of interaction: hydrogen bond, ionic, &#x03C0;-stacking, &#x03C0;-cation or van der Waals between purely hydrophobic residues. The default GetContacts interaction criteria were used for all interaction types except for hydrogen bond detection, where a more stringent 30&#x00B0; cutoff for hydrogen-donor-acceptor angle was used. Contact heatmaps were prepared using seaborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Waskom, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The representative conformations of ACD &#x2013; C-terminal peptide complexes were chosen by clustering the last 400 ns of equilibrium MD trajectories (frames spaced every 0.5 ns) using &#x201C;gmx cluster&#x201D; tool and Jarvis-Patrick clustering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jarvis &#x0026; Patrick, 1973</xref>). RMSD cutoff of 0.2 nm, was used for Jarvis-Patrick algorithm and conformations possessing at least 3 neighbors in common out of 15 closest conformations were assigned to the same cluster. RMSD calculation was based on coordinates of heavy backbone atoms of the C-terminal peptide interacting ACD monomer without dimerization loop (residues 40-74 and 95 to 126) and stably interacting region of the C-terminal peptide (residues 132-137). In the case of both simulated complexes the biggest cluster contained more than 90&#x0025; of simulation frames (92.3&#x0025; for AncA0 ACD complex and 93.3&#x0025; for Anca0 Q66H G109D complex) and its middle frame was chosen as representative conformation. Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">William <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>) and Blender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</ext-link>) were used for structure visualization.</p>
