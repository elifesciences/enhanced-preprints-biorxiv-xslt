<title>ABSTRACT</title><p>Amyloid &#x03B2; (A&#x03B2;) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity are poorly defined.</p>
<p>Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for A&#x03B2;42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for &#x03B3;-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported increases in A&#x03B2;42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on &#x03B3;-secretases, and thereby impair downstream signaling events.</p>
<p>We show that human A&#x03B2;42 peptides, but neither murine A&#x03B2;42 nor human A&#x03B2;17-42 (p3), inhibit &#x03B3;-secretases and trigger accumulation of unprocessed substrates in neurons, including C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, p75 and pan-cadherin. Moreover, A&#x03B2;42 treatment dysregulated cellular homeostasis, as shown by the induction of p75-dependent neuronal death in two distinct cellular systems.</p>
<p>Our findings raise the possibility that pathological elevations in A&#x03B2;42 contribute to cellular toxicity via the &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition, and provide a novel conceptual framework to address A&#x03B2; toxicity in the context of &#x03B3;-secretase-dependent homeostatic signaling.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>&#x0393;-secretases are ubiquitously expressed intramembrane proteases best known for their pathogenic roles in Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>). Aberrant processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by &#x03B3;-secretases leads to the production of longer, aggregation-prone amyloid &#x03B2; (A&#x03B2;) peptides that contribute to neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>In addition, &#x03B3;-secretases process many other membrane proteins, including NOTCH, ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), N-cadherin (NCAD) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></italic>). The processing of multiple substrates links their activity to a broad range of downstream signaling pathways (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></italic>), including those critical for neuronal structure and function. It is noteworthy that treatment with &#x03B3;-secretase inhibitors caused cognitive worsening in AD patients (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>), while genetic inhibition of these enzymes led to neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></italic>). The underlying mechanisms by which deficits in &#x03B3;-secretase activity impair neuronal function are yet to be defined.</p>
<p>&#x0393;-secretase activity is exerted by a family of highly homologous multimeric proteases composed of presenilin (PSEN1 or PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH1A or B) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) subunits. The proteolytic activities of these complexes are promoted by the low pH of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments, wherein the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></italic>). In the amyloidogenic pathway the proteolytic processing of APP by &#x03B2;-secretase (BACE) releases a soluble APP ectodomain and generates a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (&#x03B2;-CTF or APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></italic>). APP<sub>C99</sub> is then sequentially processed within the membrane by &#x03B3;-secretase complexes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></italic>). An initial endopeptidase (&#x03B5;-) cut releases APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol and generates a <italic>de novo</italic> substrate (either A&#x03B2;49 or A&#x03B2;48 peptide) that undergoes successive &#x03B3;-cleavages until a shortened A&#x03B2; peptide is released into the luminal or extracellular environment. The efficiency of the sequential cleavage mechanism (i.e. processivity) defines A&#x03B2; length: 37-43 amino acid long peptides, which vary in their aggregation and neurotoxic properties, are generated (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></italic>). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved by &#x03B1;- and &#x03B3;-secretases to generate a spectrum of p3 peptides, which lack the first 1-16 amino acids of A&#x03B2; (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Of note, the p3 peptides are not linked to AD pathogenesis (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></italic>) despite their relatively high hydrophobicity and aggregation prone behavior. In fact, mutations promoting the amyloidogenic processing of APP are linked to AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></italic>), while those favoring the alternative, non-amyloidogenic pathway protect against the disease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></italic>).</p>

<caption><title>Human A&#x03B2;42 peptide inhibits &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub></title>
<p>(A) The scheme depicts the &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, leading to the generation of A&#x03B2; and p3 peptides. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway &#x03B1;-secretase generates a soluble APP ectodomain and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids in length (APP<sub>C83</sub>), which is then shortened by &#x03B3;-secretase until a p3 peptide is released. In the amyloidogenic pathway, &#x03B2;-secretase generates a soluble APP ectodomain and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids in length (APP<sub>C99</sub>), which becomes a substrate for &#x03B3;-secretase.</p><p>The N-terminal sequence of APP<sub>C99</sub> /A&#x03B2; is shown in the lower panel. The differences in the amino acid sequence of human (hu) vs murine (mu) A&#x03B2; peptides and the positions of &#x03B2;&#x2019;- and &#x03B1;-cleavages (that precede the generation of A&#x03B2;11-42 and p3 17-42 peptides, respectively) are indicated. The transmembrane domain is labelled in grey and the sequence of A&#x03B2;42 is presented within a rectangle. The initial &#x03B3;-secretase endopeptidase cut may occur at one of two different positions on APP, generating two different <italic>de novo</italic> substrates that are further processed by carboxypeptidase-like cleavages as follows: A&#x03B2;49&#x2192;A&#x03B2;46&#x2192;A&#x03B2;43&#x2192;A&#x03B2;40&#x2192;A&#x03B2;37 or A&#x03B2;48 &#x2192;A&#x03B2;45&#x2192;A&#x03B2;42&#x2192;A&#x03B2;38. A&#x03B2;38, A&#x03B2;40 and A&#x03B2;42 peptides are the major products under physiological conditions. The triangles mark the sequential cleavage positions.</p><p>(B) The western blot presents AICD products generated <italic>de novo</italic> in detergent-based &#x03B3;-secretase activity assays using APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 0.4 &#x03BC;M or 1.2 &#x03BC;M as substrate. To test the inhibitory properties of human A&#x03B2;1-42, the peptide was added to the activity assays at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 &#x03BC;M. DMSO at 2.5&#x0025; was used as a vehicle control. The graphs present the quantification of the western blot bands corresponding to AICDs. The pink and green lines correspond to 0.4 &#x03BC;M and 1.2 &#x03BC;M substrate concentrations, respectively. The data are normalized to the AICD levels generated in the DMSO conditions, considered as 100&#x0025;. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SEM, N&#x003D;6-16.</p><p>(C) Mass spectrometry-based analysis of <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD levels in <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-free &#x03B3;-secretase activity assays containing 3 &#x03BC;M human A&#x03B2;1-42 or vehicle (0.6&#x0025; DMSO) indicate that human A&#x03B2;1-42 inhibits both product lines.</p><p>(D) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based &#x03B3;-secretase activity assays using 0.4 &#x03BC;M APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as substrate and wild type &#x03B3;-secretases composed of different PSEN (1 or 2) and APH1 (A or B) subunits in the presence of vehicle, human A&#x03B2;1-42 at 3 &#x03BC;M or GSI (InhX) at 10 &#x03BC;M concentration.</p><p>(E) The graph presents ELISA quantification of A&#x03B2;1-38 peptides generated in detergent- or detergent resistant membranes (DRM)-based &#x03B3;-secretase activity assays using either human A&#x03B2;1-42 at 10 &#x03BC;M or APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG at 1.5 &#x03BC;M as substrates. The data are presented as mean &#x00B1; SEM, N&#x003D;3.</p><p>(F) The western blot presents <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICDs in detergent-based &#x03B3;-secretase activity assays using 0.4 &#x03BC;M APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG as a substrate and &#x03B3;-secretase immobilized on sepharose beads. During the first round, the activity assay was supplemented with 3 &#x03BC;M A&#x03B2;1-42, 10 &#x03BC;M GSI or DMSO vehicle. After this first round, the &#x03B3;-secretase-beads were washed to remove the peptide and inhibitor, respectively, fresh substrate was added, and the reaction proceeded for the second round. The analysis demonstrates the reversibility of the A&#x03B2;1-42-mediated inhibition.</p></caption>

<p>In familial AD (FAD), mutations in PSENs or in APP/A&#x03B2; (i.e. changes impacting both the enzyme and its substrate) promote the generation of longer A&#x03B2; peptides, including A&#x03B2;42, but also A&#x03B2;43 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></italic>). These peptides accumulate in the brain and are a hallmark of AD, in both familial and sporadic forms. In the latter (SAD), the accumulation of longer, aggregation prone peptides results from their inefficient clearance (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></italic>). Irrespective of the mechanism, the accumulation of A&#x03B2; in the brain begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms and is proposed to trigger toxic cascades via poorly understood mechanisms (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Aggregation of A&#x03B2;42 into soluble toxic oligomers has been proposed as a prerequisite for its toxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></italic>). However, given the broad spectrum of brain-derived A&#x03B2; peptides and their assemblies, it seems plausible that the pleiotropic nature of A&#x03B2; actions contribute via a number of mechanisms to AD pathogenesis. Of note, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to A&#x03B2; (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></italic>), its precursor, the 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment (i.e. APP<sub>C99</sub>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></italic>) also mediates pathogenic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Herein, we explored a novel hypothesis for A&#x03B2;42 toxicity that arises from its proven affinity for &#x03B3;-secretases. We hypothesized that pathological increases in A&#x03B2; levels in the AD brain resulted in the establishment of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism, wherein A&#x03B2;1-42 competed with membrane-associated substrates for &#x03B3;-secretase processing. This hypothesis is supported by our reported observations that A&#x03B2;s with low affinity for &#x03B3;-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations, can compete with the longer, higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding and processing by the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). This hypothetical inhibitory feedback would result in the accumulation of unprocessed &#x03B3;-secretase substrates and reduced levels of their soluble intracellular domain (ICD) products, possibly disrupting downstream signaling cascades.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether A&#x03B2; peptides can exert product feedback inhibition on &#x03B3;-secretase. Our kinetic analyses demonstrate that human A&#x03B2;1-42 inhibits &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> and other substrates. Strikingly, neither murine A&#x03B2;1-42 nor human p3 (17-42 amino acids in A&#x03B2;) peptides exerted inhibition under similar conditions. We also show that human A&#x03B2;1-42-mediated inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity results in the accumulation of unprocessed CTFs of APP, p75 and pan-cadherins. To evaluate the impact of the A&#x03B2;-driven inhibition on cellular signaling, we analyzed p75-dependent activation of caspase 3 in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) and PC12 cells. These analyses demonstrate that, as seen for &#x03B3;-secretase inhibitors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), A&#x03B2;1-42 potentiates this marker of apoptosis. Our findings thus point to an entirely novel and selective role for the A&#x03B2;42 peptide, and raise the intriguing possibility that compromised &#x03B3;-secretase activity against the CTFs of APP and/or other neuronal substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<title>A&#x03B2;1-42 inhibits &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub></title>
<p>A&#x03B2; peptides displaying a relatively low affinity for &#x03B3;-secretase, when present at high concentrations, can compete with the higher affinity APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate for binding to the enzyme (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that increments in concentration of the AD-linked A&#x03B2;42 peptides may promote the establishment of a product feedback mechanism that involves the formation of &#x2018;non-productive&#x2019; enzyme-A&#x03B2;42 complexes and results in the inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretases. The A&#x03B2;42-mediated inhibition would lead to the accumulation of unprocessed &#x03B3;-secretase substrates and decreased production of their intracellular domains, both possibly contributing to dysregulated downstream signaling.</p>
<p>As a first step, we investigated the effects of human A&#x03B2;1-42 (from now on referred to as A&#x03B2;42) on the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> in well-controlled kinetic analyses (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). We incubated purified (wild type) &#x03B3;-secretase enzyme with purified APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG substrate at the K<sub>M</sub> or saturating concentrations (0.4 &#x03BC;M and 1.2 &#x03BC;M, respectively) in the presence of human A&#x03B2;42 peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.5 &#x03BC;M to 10 &#x03BC;M. We then analyzed <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD-3xFLAG by quantitative western blotting <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary figure 1</xref>)</bold>. Methanol:chloroform extraction was performed to remove the excess of unprocessed substrates, the high levels of which could preclude quantitative analysis of ICDs. The analysis demonstrated that human A&#x03B2;42 inhibited &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> in a dose dependent manner. The more pronounced peptide-driven inhibition at the lower substrate concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x003D;1.3 &#x03BC;M vs 3.6 &#x03BC;M for 0.4 and 1.2 &#x03BC;M APP<sub>C99</sub>, respectively) is consistent with a mechanism in which A&#x03B2;42 competes with the substrate for the enzyme. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses of the proteolytic reactions showed that A&#x03B2;42 inhibited the generation of both AICD product types (AICD<sub>50-99</sub> and AICD<sub>49-99</sub>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), indicating that A&#x03B2;42 inhibits both &#x03B3;-secretase product lines. Next, we tested whether human A&#x03B2;42 exerts inhibition on all members of the &#x03B3;-secretase family &#x2013; i.e. irrespective of the type of PSEN (1 vs 2) and APH1 (A vs B) subunits (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). Quantitative western blotting analysis revealed a marked inhibition of total AICD production by all types of &#x03B3;-secretases in the presence of 3 &#x00B5;M human A&#x03B2;42. These findings support a competitive mechanism wherein low-affinity substrates (normally acting as products) are able to re-associate with the protease and inhibit the processing of substrates when present at relatively high concentrations.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the inhibitory mechanism, we investigated &#x03B3;-secretase mediated processing of A&#x03B2;42 to A&#x03B2;38 under the conditions used to examine APP<sub>C99</sub>, using the latter as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). The results showed that, despite the use of relatively high concentrations of A&#x03B2;42 (10 &#x00B5;M), this peptide was not converted into A&#x03B2;38, while proteolytic reactions using APP<sub>C99</sub> (1.5 &#x03BC;M) resulted in the generation of A&#x03B2;38 (0.5-1 nM). We also tested whether A&#x03B2;42 served as a substrate in a native-like environment, i.e. detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></italic>). As in detergent conditions, A&#x03B2;42 was barely converted into A&#x03B2;38. Of note, we have shown that &#x03B3;-secretase processes A&#x03B2;43 into A&#x03B2;40 under similar conditions, even when this peptide was added at much lower concentrations (0.5-1 &#x00B5;M) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). These observations indicate that exogenous A&#x03B2;42, in contrast to A&#x03B2;43, does not act as a substrate in these conditions. Accordingly, A&#x03B2;42-driven inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretases supports formation of non-productive enzyme-substrate (E-S) like complexes as an underlying mechanism. Nevertheless, a scenario wherein A&#x03B2;42 interacts with APP<sub>C99</sub> to reduce the amount of free APP<sub>C99</sub> substrate available for the enzymatic cleavage was not excluded by these data.</p>
<p>Whether or not the inhibitory effects of A&#x03B2;42 on &#x03B3;-secretase were reversible was also evaluated. To this end, using a high affinity anti-NCSTN nanobody we conjugated purified &#x03B3;-secretase complexes to beads and incubated the &#x2018;enzyme-attached&#x2019; beads with 0.4 &#x00B5;M APP<sub>C99</sub>, in the absence or presence of 3 &#x00B5;M A&#x03B2;42, for 40 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C. This concentration of peptide substantially inhibited AICD generation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). As a control, 10 &#x00B5;M &#x03B3;-secretase inhibitor X (GSI, Inh X) was included. After incubation we collected the supernatants, washed the beads in assay buffer and re-incubated them with 0.4 &#x00B5;M APP<sub>C99</sub> for 40 minutes at 37&#x00B0;C. Analysis of the levels of the <italic>de novo</italic> generated AICD products in the supernatant fractions collected after the first incubation indicated that A&#x03B2;42 inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase was fully reversible (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Collectively, our analyses support a model wherein A&#x03B2;42 forms non-productive E-S like complex with &#x03B3;-secretase and its binding is reversible.</p>

<title>The N- and C-termini of A&#x03B2; play key roles in the inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity</title>
<p>We next investigated the structure-function relationships relevant for the A&#x03B2;42-driven inhibitory mechanism. The effects of mouse/rat (murine) A&#x03B2;42 and N-terminally truncated human A&#x03B2;x-42 (11-42 and 17-42) peptides on &#x03B3;-secretases activity were examined in cell-free assays using peptide concentrations ranging from 0.5 &#x03BC;M to 10 &#x03BC;M (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref></bold>). Quantification of the <italic>de novo</italic> AICD product levels showed that murine A&#x03B2;42 maximally inhibits &#x03B3;-secretases activity by &#x223C;20&#x0025; (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Because three amino acids in the N-terminal domain (R5G, Y10F and H13R) differentiate human and murine A&#x03B2;1-42 peptides (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), the differences in inhibition thus defined the N-terminal domain of A&#x03B2; as contributing to the inhibitory mechanism. The analyses of other naturally occurring N-terminally truncated A&#x03B2;x-42 peptides, generated by &#x03B2;-secretase (alternative) cleavage at position 11 or by &#x03B1;-secretase cut at position 17 in the A&#x03B2; sequence, demonstrated that relative to A&#x03B2;42, the truncated peptides presented reduced inhibitory potencies. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for A&#x03B2;11-42 were reduced 1.79- and 1.31-fold (K<sub>M</sub> and saturating substrate concentrations, respectively), relative to A&#x03B2;42 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</bold>, while the larger N-terminal truncation (of residues 1-16) abolished the inhibitory effect (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data assign a defining role for the N-terminal region of A&#x03B2; in mediating the inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity.</p>

<p>We next tested whether longer A&#x03B2; peptides (&#x003E;A&#x03B2;42), that form more stable interactions with the protease (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), also inhibit &#x03B3;-secretase activity. In addition, we investigated whether shortening of the C-terminus diminishes the inhibitory properties. To this end, we evaluated a series of naturally occurring A&#x03B2;1-x peptides, ranging from 37 to 43 amino acids in length, at 1 &#x00B5;M final concentration, for their effects on &#x03B3;-secretase proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). In these experiments reducing the DMSO (vehicle) concentration to 0.2&#x0025; was attended by enhanced A&#x03B2;-mediated inhibition by &#x223C;1.7 fold relative to the conditions shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. We speculate that increased A&#x03B2; potency under these conditions is explained by a modest but measurable reduction in proteolysis by the higher concentration of DMSO used in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> assays (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></italic>). Relative to A&#x03B2;42, shorter A&#x03B2; species exerted progressively less or no inhibition on the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of AICD. Of note, peptides longer than A&#x03B2;42 serve as a substrate of &#x03B3;-secretases in these conditions and might be converted into shorter, less potent species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Taken together, the data strengthen the conclusion that human A&#x03B2;42 inhibits &#x03B3;-secretases and indicate that both A&#x03B2; C- and N-termini modulate the inhibitory mechanism.</p>

<title>Human A&#x03B2;42 inhibits endogenous &#x03B3;-secretase activity in neurons</title>
<p>The consistent inhibitory properties of human A&#x03B2;42 demonstrated in cell-free systems motivated cellular studies to address the effects of this peptide on the processing of &#x03B3;-secretase substrates in cellular context. We applied an established cell-based &#x03B3;-secretase activity assay to test <italic>in situ</italic> the protease activity in primary mouse neurons (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). This assay utilizes an APP<sub>C99</sub>-based fluorescent substrate (the C99 Y-T biosensor) to probe &#x03B3;-secretase activity <italic>in situ</italic>. This biosensor comprises APP<sub>C99</sub> fused at the C-terminus with YPet, followed by a linker, Turquoise-GL and a membrane anchoring domain to stabilize the probe in the membrane. The cleavage of the APP<sub>C99</sub>-based probe by endogenous &#x03B3;-secretases extends the distance between YPet and Turquoise-GL, and therefore results in a decrease in the efficiency of F&#x04E7;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for this pair. The ratiometric nature of the reporter, and its independence of &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-secretase activity and cellular degradation mechanisms, allow quantitative analysis of &#x03B3;-secretase activity in living cells.</p>

The increase in the distance translates to the reduced FRET efficiency, quantified by the YPet/Turquoise-GL fluorescence ratio. The distribution of recorded FRET efficiency, inversely correlating with &#x03B3;-secretase activity, is shown in the density plots, N&#x003D;4 (n&#x003D;331-354). Medians are shown as dashed lines.

<p>To determine the effects of A&#x03B2; or p3 peptides on &#x03B3;-secretase, we treated mouse primary neurons with human A&#x03B2;42, p3, GSI (1 &#x03BC;M DAPT) or vehicle (DMSO) for 24h and performed FRET analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref></bold>). While p3 peptides did not affect the FRET signal, significant increases in FRET efficiency (i.e. increased proximity between YPet and Turquoise-GL) in cells treated with human A&#x03B2;42 or GSI, relative to vehicle treated cultures, indicated increments in the levels of the full-length (uncleaved) fluorescent substrate, and thus reduced &#x03B3;-secretase activity. These findings thus provided, in a cellular context, quantitative evidence supporting the inhibition of endogenous &#x03B3;-secretases by human A&#x03B2;42, but not p3 17-42 peptides.</p>

<title>A&#x03B2;42 treatment leads to the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments in neuronal cell lines and human neurons</title>
<p>We then reasoned that human A&#x03B2;42-driven inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity would lead to the accumulation of unprocessed &#x03B3;-secretase substrates in cells: APP-CTFs in the case of APP. To test this possibility, we treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and human neural progenitor cells (ReNcell VM) with either human A&#x03B2;42 or p3 17-42 at 1 &#x03BC;M or 2.5 &#x03BC;M final concentrations, and analyzed the levels of APP-CTFs and full-length APP (APP-FL) by western blotting (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-C</xref></bold>). Treatment with GSI (InhX) at 2 &#x03BC;M was included as a positive control, and APP-FL amounts were used to normalize for the APP substrate availability. Human A&#x03B2;42 treatment increased the APP-CTF/FL ratio, a read-out of &#x03B3;-secretase activity. In contrast, treatment with p3 peptide had no effect. To control for overall cellular toxicity of A&#x03B2;42 peptides, we performed two cellular toxicity assays (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref></bold>). In the first, we quantified the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by cells into medium upon plasma membrane damage. In the second, we detected cellular ATP as a reporter of viability. There was no significant change in these measures in response to addition for 24h of A&#x03B2;42 (1 &#x03BC;M), p3 17-42 (1 &#x03BC;M), or GSI (2 &#x03BC;M) on SH-SY5Y cells.</p>

<p>We next asked if A&#x03B2; from disease-relevant biological sources would recapitulate the effects of recombinant A&#x03B2;42. For these studies we used culture medium conditioned by human iPSC-derived neurons expressing APP wild type or the KM670/671NL (SWE) variant. The APP SWE mutation increases total A&#x03B2; production by promoting the amyloidogenic processing of APP. ELISA-based quantification of A&#x03B2; content estimated a total concentration in the low nanomolar range (0.5-1 nM). Conditioned medium (WT or SWE) was applied to PC12 cells either directly or after A&#x03B2; depletion (delSWE) using the anti-APP 3D6 (epitope A&#x03B2; 1-5) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). After a 24h incubation at 37&#x00B0;C, the APP-CTF/FL ratio was measured. Cells incubated in control, unconditioned media were used as a reference control. We observed significant increments in the APP-CTF/FL ratio in cells treated with SWE conditioned media, relative to control cells. A&#x03B2; immunodepletion from the SWE medium (delSWE-CM) lowered the APP-CTF/FL ratio to the levels observed in the control cells. These data provide evidence that A&#x03B2; peptides derived from biological sources induce accumulation of APP-CTFs even when present at low nM concentrations, and thus point to this biological source of A&#x03B2; peptides as being far more potent than recombinant A&#x03B2;42.</p>

<p>These observations provided evidence that A&#x03B2;42 differs from other tested peptides in one or more features that are critical for &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition in cells. Previous studies have shown that selective cellular uptake of human A&#x03B2;42, relative to A&#x03B2;40, leading to its concentration in the acidic endolysosomal network (ELN), promotes peptide aggregation into soluble toxic A&#x03B2; species (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). We reasoned that since this compartment is the main locus of &#x03B3;-secretase activity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></italic>), the concentration of A&#x03B2;42 in ELN may not only promote its aggregation but also facilitate its inhibitory actions on &#x03B3;-secretases. To investigate whether the selective accumulation of A&#x03B2;42 in ELN, relative to other tested peptides, could explain the differential (cellular) inhibitory profiles of the tested peptides (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), we treated PC12 cells with human A&#x03B2;40, A&#x03B2;42, A&#x03B2;43 or p3 17-42, or murine A&#x03B2;42 peptides at 1 &#x00B5;M final concentration for 24h, and investigated their intracellular pools by immunostaining with an anti-A&#x03B2;/p3 antibody, 4G8 (epitope: 17-23 aa). We found that, unlike other A&#x03B2; or p3 peptides, human A&#x03B2;42 accumulated in cells. The data is consistent with a model in which selective cellular uptake and/or intracellular accumulation of A&#x03B2;42 distinguishes it from the other examined peptides and explains its unique inhibitory properties in the cellular context.</p>

<title>Human A&#x03B2;42 peptides inhibit proteolysis of other &#x03B3;-secretase substrates, beyond APP-CTFs</title>
<p>The A&#x03B2;42-mediated inhibition of endogenous &#x03B3;-secretase activity in cells raises the possibility that A&#x03B2;42 would inhibit the processing of &#x03B3;-secretase substrates beyond APP-CTFs. To address this possibility, we analyzed in cell-free conditions the effects of human A&#x03B2;42 on the processing of a purified NOTCH1-based substrate (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). We incubated purified &#x03B3;-secretase and the NOTCH1-based substrate (at 0.4 &#x03BC;M or 1.2 &#x03BC;M concentrations) in the presence of increasing amounts of human A&#x03B2;1-42 (ranging from 0.5 &#x03BC;M to 10 &#x03BC;M). Quantification of the <italic>de novo</italic> generated NICD-3xFLAG showed a dose dependent inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase proteolysis of NOTCH1 by A&#x03B2;42. As for APP<sub>C99</sub>, the derived IC<sub>50</sub> values showed that the degree of the inhibition depended on substrate concentration, consistent with a competitive mechanism <bold>(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)</bold>. We extended this analysis by assessing the &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated proteolysis of other substrates (ERBB4-, neurexin- and p75-based) in the presence of 3 &#x03BC;M human A&#x03B2;42 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). Quantification of the respective <italic>de novo</italic> generated ICDs revealed that A&#x03B2;42 reduced &#x03B3;-secretase proteolysis of each of these substrates.

<p>We next investigated the effects of human A&#x03B2;42 on the &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated processing of pan-cadherin in ReNcell VM cells. Cleavage of cadherins by &#x03B1;-secretase generates a membrane bound CTF, which is a direct substrate of &#x03B3;-secretases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></italic>). As before, we used the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio to estimate the efficiency of the &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated proteolytic processing (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Human A&#x03B2;42 and InhX, but not p3, treatments resulted in significant increments in the PanCad-CTF/FL ratio, demonstrating that A&#x03B2;42 inhibits processing of several different &#x03B3;-secretase substrates. These results suggest that this peptide may be able to generally impact proteolysis of &#x03B3;-secretases substrates.</p>
<p>In demonstrating that A&#x03B2;42 inhibits &#x03B3;-secretase proteolysis of substrates that are structurally distinct from APP-CTFs, these data point to A&#x03B2;42 inhibiting enzyme activity independent of substrate structure. In so doing, they render much less likely the mechanistic possibility considered above, that inhibition is due to interaction with the substrate.</p>

<title>Human A&#x03B2;42 driven accumulation of p75-CTF induces markers of neuronal death</title>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor plays a prominent role in neurotrophin signaling. Under certain conditions its C-terminal fragment (p75-CTF, a &#x03B3;-secretase substrate) modulates cell death (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></italic>). Previous studies have shown that accumulation of p75-CTF in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), due to pharmacological inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretases, triggers apoptosis in a TrkA activity dependent manner (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). The proapoptotic action of p75-CTF is prevented by expression of the TrkA receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), which serves as a co-receptor with p75 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Similar observations were made in PC12 cells, which model sympathetic neurons. In this case, &#x03B3;-secretase inhibitors increased apoptosis in TrkA-deficient (PC12nnr5) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></italic>), but not in wild type, TrkA expressing cells. These findings provided an experimental system to investigate the effects of A&#x03B2;42 mediated inhibition on &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated signaling in neurons and neuron-like cells.</p>
<p>We tested the impact of A&#x03B2; on p75 signaling in wild type and PC12nnr5 cells. We exposed the cells to 1 &#x00B5;M human A&#x03B2;42, 1 &#x00B5;M p3, GSI (10 &#x00B5;M compound E) or vehicle (DMSO) for 3 days, and measured apoptosis via immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase 3 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>). In addition, to assess &#x03B3;-secretase proteolysis of p75, we measured the p75-CTF/FL ratio in the treated cultures (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Cleaved caspase 3 staining was increased in PC12nnr5 cells treated with GSI or human A&#x03B2;42, but not in those exposed to p3 or vehicle (DMSO). Of note, and consistent with past findings (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), none of the treatments elicited significant increases in cleaved caspase 3 in wild type PC12 cells that express physiological levels of TrkA. In addition, analysis of the p75-CTF/FL ratio demonstrated higher p75-CTF levels in GSI and A&#x03B2;42 treated cells. These results, together with our previous observations, strongly suggest that A&#x03B2;42-mediated accumulation of p75-CTFs results in cell death signaling in the absence or near absence of TrkA expression. Our similar studies using BFCNs recapitulated the reported increased cell death under conditions in which both &#x03B3;-secretase and TrkA activities were inhibited (CE and K252&#x03B1; inhibitor) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>), and showed that treatment with 1 &#x00B5;M human A&#x03B2;42 mimics the increase in cleaved caspase 3 driven by the GSI (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). In conclusion, these results strongly support a novel role for human A&#x03B2;42 peptide in the global inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity and point to this A&#x03B2;42-induced mechanism as dysregulating cellular homeostasis.</p>

<title>A&#x03B2;42-mediated &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition is the major mechanism contributing to APP-CTF accumulation in cells</title>
<p>Our data derived from well-controlled, cell-free systems and cell-based assays utilizing a concentration independent (FRET) reporter of &#x03B3;-secretase activity support a direct impact of A&#x03B2;42 peptides on the activity of the enzyme. Of note, these systems are independent of &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-secretase cleavages as well as cellular degradation pathway, hence they allow selective and specific analysis of &#x03B3;-secretase activity. Nevertheless, it is possible that in cells all or some of the aforementioned mechanisms act jointly and converge on the observed increase in APP-CTFs.</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of A&#x03B2;42 on &#x03B1;-secretase (ADAM10) and &#x03B2;-secretase (BACE1), the increased expression or activity of which could result in increased APP-CTF levels, we analyzed the levels of soluble APP (sAPP) in conditioned medium collected from SH-SY5Y cells treated with A&#x03B2;40 (1 &#x03BC;M), A&#x03B2;42 (1 &#x03BC;M), p3 17-42 (1 &#x03BC;M), GSI (InhX, 2 &#x03BC;M) or vehicle DMSO control, as well as the expression of ADAM10 and BACE1 in total cell lysates <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary figure 3</xref>)</bold>. We found no evidence for either increased &#x03B1;-secretase and &#x03B2;-secretase levels or activity. Our analysis actually showed a reduction in sAPP levels in the conditioned medium collected from cells treated with A&#x03B2;42. Further studies are required to define whether the sAPP decrease in a consequent of sheddase inhibition.</p>
<p>Next, to evaluate potential &#x03B3;-secretase independent changes in the degradation of APP-CTF, we assessed the impact of A&#x03B2;42 peptides on &#x03B3;-secretase independent APP-CTF half-life using a well-established cycloheximide (CHX)-based assay. CHX inhibits protein synthesis through blocking translation elongation (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></italic>). In these experiments, we pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with either GSI (DAPT, 10 &#x03BC;M) or GSI &#x002B; A&#x03B2;42 (1 &#x03BC;M) for 24h to accumulate APP-CTFs. Next, we added CHX (50 &#x03BC;g/ml) and then collected the cells thereafter at 0h, 1h, 2.5h and 5h. Bafilomycin A1 (200 nM), which de-acidifies lysosomes and compromises degradation, was used as a positive control (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and B</xref></bold>). Quantitative analysis of the levels of both APP-CTFs and APP-FL over the 5h time-course failed to reveal significant differences between A&#x03B2;42 treated cells and controls. As expected, Bafilomycin A1 treatment markedly prolonged the half-life of both proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). This study demonstrated the lack of a significant impact of A&#x03B2;42 on the half-life of APP-CTFs under the conditions of &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition. However, we noted increased APP-CTF/FL ratio in GSI &#x002B; A&#x03B2;42 treated cells vs GSI &#x002B; DMSO treated cells at zero time point. The additive effect of A&#x03B2;42 in setting of full pharmacological inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase suggests that A&#x03B2;42-mediated increases in APP-CTFs are mediated by both inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase as well as one or more additional mechanisms (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, the greater relative accumulation of APP-CTFs in the absence (138&#x0025;) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>) versus the presence of the GSI (48&#x0025;) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>) is evidence that A&#x03B2;42-mediated &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition plays a more incisive role.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Compelling evidence supports that A&#x03B2; peptides trigger molecular and cellular cascades that result in neurodegeneration (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></italic>). Here, we discovered and thoroughly characterized a previously unreported role for A&#x03B2;: inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase complexes. The recognition that A&#x03B2; peptides, despite lower affinities, can compete with APP-CTFs for binding to &#x03B3;-secretase, when present at relatively high concentrations (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>), led us to propose a mechanism that connects increases in the A&#x03B2;42 peptide with inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretases. We note that two different mechanisms involving &#x03B3;-secretases are known to cause neurodegeneration: &#x03B3;-secretase dysfunction in autosomal dominant FAD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>) and &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition, leading to age-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>). The mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of dysfunction and inhibition are poorly understood, though it is clear that the former implicates A&#x03B2; metabolism, while the second is independent of APP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></italic>). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity has been linked to cognitive worsening in AD affected individuals (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>To explore the possible links between &#x03B3;-secretase dysfunction (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></italic>) and &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>) we analyzed &#x03B3;-secretase endopeptidase activity in well-controlled cell-free assays, using purified protease and substrate. The data demonstrated that human A&#x03B2;42 inhibited the processing of APP<sub>C99</sub> by all members of the human &#x03B3;-secretase family. Notably, despite the high homology between human and murine A&#x03B2; sequences, murine A&#x03B2;1-42 peptide failed to inhibit the proteolysis of APP<sub>C99</sub>, implying that structural determinants in the N-terminal domain of A&#x03B2; are involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Consistent with this view, N-terminally truncated A&#x03B2; peptides (A&#x03B2;11-42 and p3 17-42) demonstrated reduced or no inhibitory properties, compared to human A&#x03B2;42. Of note, the p3 peptide lacks the 16 amino acid long, hydrophilic and disordered N-terminal domain present in A&#x03B2; peptides, but does contain the two aggregation prone regions (16&#x2013;21 and 29-42) required for the assembly of oligomers (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></italic>) and fibrils (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></italic>). Despite p3 peptide&#x2019;s aggregation prone behavior (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></italic>) and accumulation in AD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></italic>), whether this peptide is responsible for toxicity is not well defined (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Our analyses in cell-free systems revealed that the C-terminus of A&#x03B2; also modulates its intrinsic inhibitory properties, with shorter A&#x03B2;1-x species (x&#x003D; 37, 38, 40) either not acting as inhibitors or inhibiting the protease to a lesser degree than human A&#x03B2;42. The reported lower affinities of shorter A&#x03B2; peptides towards &#x03B3;-secretase may, at least partially, explain their decreased inhibitory potencies (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Further investigations on cultures of neurons and neuron-like cells showed that extracellularly applied human A&#x03B2;42 resulted in the accumulation of unprocessed &#x03B3;-secretase substrates. Given that the accumulation of the substrates may stem from multiple cellular pathways, such as sheddase activation or protein degradation impairments, we quantified A&#x03B2;42-driven inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase using a live cell FRET-based imaging assay that is independent of the aforementioned alternative cellular processes, and hence specifically and selectively reports on the substrate proteolysis by endogenous &#x03B3;-secretases. These analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in the global &#x03B3;-secretase activity in neurons treated with human A&#x03B2;42, but not with p3.</p>
<p>In contrast to findings in cell-free assays, &#x03B3;-secretase inhibition in cells was only observed for human A&#x03B2;42. Other A&#x03B2; and p3 peptides did not trigger the accumulation of unprocessed APP-CTFs. Reports showing that A&#x03B2; conformation affects both cellular internalization and neurotoxicity (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></italic>) motivated us to test the possibility that A&#x03B2;42, unlike other A&#x03B2; peptides, acquires specific conformations that promote endocytosis and/or inhibit intracellular degradation. Earlier reports of the selective uptake of A&#x03B2;42, relative to A&#x03B2;40 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></italic>), facilitating concentration of A&#x03B2;42 in spatially restricted endosomal compartments, would support this postulation. Our data showing marked increases in the intracellular levels of A&#x03B2;42, but not A&#x03B2;40 or A&#x03B2;43, in cells add to the evidence for peptide-specific differences, but whether they are due to changes in cellular uptake, metabolism or both that lead to higher A&#x03B2;42 concentrations and product-feedback inhibition requires further study.</p>
<p>Evidence that A&#x03B2;42 exerts a general inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase activity is provided by data showing that this peptide also reduced processing of non-APP &#x03B3;-secretase substrates, including NOTCH, neurexin, pan-cadherin and p75. The inhibitory curves revealed stronger inhibition of NOTCH than APP<sub>C99</sub> cleavage, which may arise from the lower stability of &#x03B3;-secretase interactions with NOTCH, relative to APP<sub>C99</sub> (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></italic>). Considering the poor sequence homology between distinct &#x03B3;-secretase substrates and the general A&#x03B2;-mediated inhibitory effect, we reason that the inhibitory action of A&#x03B2;42 likely involves its interaction with the protease, rather than with the substrate.</p>
<p>Having observed a general impact of A&#x03B2;42 on &#x03B3;-secretase activity, we investigated the effects of A&#x03B2;42 on &#x03B3;-secretase-mediated signaling. Specifically, our analyses demonstrated that treatment of BFCNs (or PC12 cells) with human A&#x03B2;42, but not with p3, compromised the processing of p75, increased p75-CTF levels and, in the absence of TrkA, triggered apoptotic cell death. These observations recapitulated reported findings showing that GSI treatment of BFCNs triggers p75-driven cell-death under similar conditions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Of note, these studies also showed that apoptosis in BFCNs subjected to GSI and TrkA signaling inhibitor treatments was rescued in p75 KO BFCNs, demonstrating that cell death is p75-dependent (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></italic>). Our findings showing that A&#x03B2;42 treatment mimics GSI-driven p75-dependent apoptosis in BFCNs support the inhibitory role of A&#x03B2;42 and links it to dysregulation of downstream signaling cascades. We note a prior study that showed that injection of A&#x03B2;42 into the hippocampus of adult mice resulted in the degeneration of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive forebrain neurons in wild type but not p75-NTR-deficient mice, a report that noted a correlation between A&#x03B2;42-driven neuronal death and accumulation of p75-CTFs (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></italic>). Our findings provide mechanistic bases for these observations.</p>
<p>Endocytic uptake of extracellular A&#x03B2;, the extracellular concentration of which is estimated to be at pM to low nM range in the brain, was shown to concentrate A&#x03B2;42 to &#x03BC;M levels in the endolysosomal compartments (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></italic>). Within these compartments, the presence of peptides at high concentration and at low pH would serve to facilitate A&#x03B2; aggregation and toxicity. We speculate that this mechanism could in addition promote the inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretases. Given the reported role for APP<sub>C99</sub> in inducing dysregulation of the endolysosomal network, the potential A&#x03B2;42-mediated inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase processing of APP-CTFs could drive dysregulation of endolysosomal function leading to changes in synaptic, axonal signaling and degradative functions (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></italic>). Equally intriguing is the possibility that the inhibition of other &#x03B3;-secretase substrates by A&#x03B2;42 could contribute to neurodegeneration, as reported previously for the genetic inactivation of these enzymes (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>The A&#x03B2;-mediated inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase may also help to explain the intriguing accumulation of APP-CTFs in the heterozygous FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></italic>). In this regard, the direct quantification of &#x03B3;-secretase activity in detergent resistant fractions prepared from post-mortem brain samples of healthy controls and FAD-linked mutation carriers revealed similar overall &#x03B3;-secretase activity levels, indicating that the normal (PSEN1 and PSEN2) &#x03B3;-secretase complexes rescue any potential mutation-driven deficits in the processing of APP (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>). Yet APP-CTFs have been reported to accumulate in the FAD brain (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></italic>). The inhibition of &#x03B3;-secretase by A&#x03B2;42 could resolve the apparent conflict. Our data could also reconcile two at first glance exclusive hypothesis on the effects of FAD mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> on the development of AD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></italic>). Specifically, the mutation-driven dysfunction on &#x03B3;-secretase (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></italic>), leading to enhanced generation of A&#x03B2;42, may result in &#x03B3;-secretase loss-of-function phenotypes that stem from the described here inhibitory effects.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data raise the intriguing possibility that local elevations in A&#x03B2;42 in the AD brain, and in particular in the endolysosomal compartment, facilitate the establishment of an A&#x03B2;-driven inhibitory mechanism that contributes to neurotoxicity by impairing critical &#x03B3;-secretase signaling functions (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref></bold>). Finally, by mechanistically connecting elevated A&#x03B2;42 levels with accumulation of multiple &#x03B3;-secretase substrates, our observations integrate two pathways leading to neurodegeneration and offer a novel conceptual framework for investigations of the molecular and cellular bases of AD pathogenesis.</p>

After centrifuging at 1000xg for 10 minutes, post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected. The PNS was further centrifuged at 10800xg for 10 minutes to isolate the pellet fractions (P2, crude synaptosome). The P2 fraction was resuspended in HB and loaded on top of a three-step (3&#x0025;, 10&#x0025; and 23&#x0025;) Percoll gradient, and centrifuged at 14500xg for 12 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C in a Fiberlite F21-8 x 50y Fixed-Angle Rotor (Thermo Fisher, USA). The synaptosome-rich interface between 10&#x0025; and 23&#x0025; Percoll layers was collected and resuspended in 30 volumes of HB. The diluted material was centrifuged at 18500xg for 30 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C, and the synaptosome-enriched pellet was resuspended in HB supplemented with 10 mM glucose. 10-15 &#x03BC;g of synaptosome was incubated with A&#x03B2;42 peptide at 2.5 &#x03BC;M final concentration at 37&#x00B0;C for 18h. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. One synaptosomal sample was treated with 200 nM of Compound E. Following incubation, samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and western blotting was performed using anti-APP Y188 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. All densitometric analyses were performed using NIH ImageJ software. The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California San Diego.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Excel, GraphPad Prism, R 4.2.2. and R Studio software. The following R packages were used for the analysis: readxl, ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, DescTools, gridExtra and reshape2 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></italic>). P&#x003C;0.05 was considered as a predetermined threshold for statistical significance. One-way or two-way ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnett&#x2019;s, Tukey&#x2019;s or Dunn multiple comparison test or unpaired Student&#x2019;s t-test were used, as described in the legends.</p>

<p>Analysis of AICD-3xFLAG levels that are <italic>de novo</italic> generated by purified &#x03B3;-secretase from the APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG substrate is shown. &#x0393;-secretase inhibitor (GSI) and catalytically inactive &#x03B3;-secretase mutant (DA) were used as negative controls. The left side of the blot presents analysis of unfractionated &#x03B3;-secretase activity assay samples, while the hydrophilic fraction obtained through methanol:chloroform extraction in presented on the right side. This protein extraction method allows quantification of AICDs without interference of the signal coming from the excess of APP<sub>C99</sub>-3xFLAG substrate present in the assays. &#x002A; marks a hydrophobic contaminant.</p></caption>
